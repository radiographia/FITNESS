AAS causes not only direct stimulation of the androgen receptor, but also supports muscle growth by increasing the levels of free androgens, increasing androgen receptor density, inhibiting corticosteroid action, increasing GH/IGF-1, and suppressing IGF-1 binding proteins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">fails to recognize other factors in the potency of these compounds, such as their long half-lives, estrogenic activity, and weak interaction with restrictive binding proteins (see: Free vs. Bound Testosterone). While there may  possibly  be  differences  in  the  way  various compounds could foster growth indirectly, such that advantages might even be found with certain synergistic drug combinations, the primary mode of action with all of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">these compounds is the androgen receptor. The notion that steroid X and Y must never be stacked together because they both compete for the same receptor when stimulating growth, while X and Z should be combined because they work via different mechanisms, should likewise not be taken too seriously. Such classifications are based  on  speculation  only,  and  upon  reasonable investigation are clearly invalid.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Free vs. Bound Testosterone</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A very small amount of testosterone actually exists in a free state, where interaction with cellular receptors is possible.The majority will be bound to the proteins SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin, also referred to as sex steroid  binding  globulin  and  testosterone-estradiol binding  globulin)  and  albumin,  which  temporarily prevent  the  hormone  from  exerting  activity.  Steroid hormones actually bind much more avidly to SHBG than albumin (with approximately 1,000 times greater affinity), however albumin is present in a level 1,000 times greater than SHBG.Therefore, the activity of both binding proteins in  the  body  is  relatively  equal.  The  distribution  of testosterone in men is typically 45% of testosterone bound to SHBG, and about 53% bound to albumin. The remaining 2% of the average blood concentration exists in a free, unbound state. In women, the percentage of free testosterone is lower, measured to be approximately 1%.A binding protein called ABP (androgen binding protein) also  helps  to  mediate  androgen  activity  in  the reproductive system,although since it is found exclusively in these tissues, it is not relevant to muscle growth.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The level of free testosterone available in the blood is likewise an important factor mediating its activity, as only a small percentage is really active at any given time. It must also be noted that as we alter testosterone to form new anabolic/androgenic steroids, we also typically alter the affinity in which the steroid will bind to plasma proteins.This is an important consideration, as the higher percentage we have of free hormone, the more active the compound should be on a milligram for milligram basis. And the variance can be substantial between different compounds.  For  example,  Proviron®  (1-methyl dihydrotestosterone) binds with SHBG many times more avidly  than  testosterone,<span class="s33">19  </span>while  mibolerone  (7,17 dimethyl-nandrolone)  and  bolasterone  (7,17  dimethyl­ testosterone) show virtually no affinity for this protein at all (clearly the reason these steroids are such potent androgens).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The level of SHBG present in the body is also variable, and can be altered by a number of factors. The most prominent seems to be the concentration of estrogen and thyroid hormones present in the blood. We generally see a reduction in the amount of this plasma binding protein as estrogen and thyroid content decreases, and a rise in SHBG as they increase. A heightened androgen level due to the administration of anabolic/androgenic steroids has also  been  shown  to  lower  levels  of  this  protein considerably. This is clearly supported by a 1989 German study, which noted a strong tendency for SHBG reduction with the oral anabolic steroid stanozolol (Winstrol®).<span class="s33">20</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">After only 3 days of administering a daily dose of .2mg/kg body-weight (about 18mg for a 200lb man), SHBG was lowered nearly 50% in normal subjects. Similar results have  been  obtained  with  the  use  of  injectable testosterone enanthate; however, milligram for milligram, the effect of stanozolol was much greater in comparison. The form of administration may have been important in reaching this level of response. Although the injectable was not tried in the German study, we can refer to others comparing the effect of oral vs. transdermal estrogen.<span class="s33">21 </span>These show a much greater response in SHBG levels when the drug is given orally. This is perhaps explained by the fact that SHBG is produced in the liver. Therefore, we cannot assume that injectable Winstrol® (or .injectable steroids in general) will display the same level of potency in this regard.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Lowering the level of plasma binding proteins is also not the only mechanism that allows for an increased level of free testosterone. Steroids that display a high affinity for these proteins may also increase the level of free testosterone by competing with it for binding. Obviously if testosterone finds it more difficult to locate available plasma  proteins  in  the  presence  of  the  additional compound, more will be left in an unbound state. A number  of  steroids  including  dihydrotestosterone, Proviron®,        and        Oral-Turinabol (chlorodehydromethyltestosterone)  display  a  strong tendency for this effect. If the level of free-testosterone can be altered by the use of different anabolic/androgenic steroids, the possibility also exists that one steroid can increase the potency of another through these same mechanisms. For example, Proviron® is a poor anabolic, but its extremely high affinity for SHBG might make it useful by allowing the displacement of other steroids that are more active in these tissues.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">We must not let this discussion lead us into thinking that binding proteins serve no valuable function. In fact they play a vital role in the transport and functioning of endogenous androgens. Binding proteins act to protect the steroid against rapid metabolism, ensure a more stable blood hormone concentration, and facilitate an even distribution of hormone to various body organs.The recent discovery of a specific receptor for Sex Hormone- Binding Globulin (SHBG-R) located on the membrane surface of steroid responsive body cells also suggests a much more complicated role for this protein than solely hormone  transport.  However,  it  remains  clear  that manipulating the tendency of a hormone to exist in an unbound state is an effective way to alter drug potency.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Estrogen Aromatization</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Testosterone is the primary substrate used in the male body for the synthesis of estrogen (estradiol), the principal female sex hormone. Although the presence of estrogen may seem quite unusual in men, it is structurally very similar to testosterone. With <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>slight alteration by the enzyme aromatase, estrogen is produced in the male body. Aromatase activity occurs in various regions of the male body, including adipose,<span class="s33">22 </span>liver,<span class="s33">23 </span>gonadal,<span class="s33">24 </span>central nervous system,<span class="s33">25 </span>and skeletal muscle<span class="s33">26 </span>tissues. In the context of the average healthy male, the amount of estrogen produced is generally not very significant to one&#39;s body disposition, and may even be beneficial in terms  of  cholesterol  values  (See  Side  Effects: Cardiovascular Disease). However, in larger amounts it does have potential to cause many unwanted effects including  water  retention,  female  breast  tissue development (gynecomastia), and body fat accumulation. For these reasons, many focus on minimizing the build-up or activity of estrogen in the body with aromatase inhibitors  such  as  Arimidex  and  Cytadren,  or  anti­ estrogens such as Clomid or Nolvadex, particularly at times when gynecomastia is a worry or the athlete is attempting to increase muscle definition.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark8">We must, however, not be led into thinking that estrogen serves no benefit. It is actually a desirable hormone in many  regards.  Athletes  have  known  for  years that estrogenic steroids are the best mass builders, but it is only recently that we are finally coming to understand the underlying mechanisms why. It appears that reasons go beyond the simple size, weight, and strength increases that  one  would  attribute  to  estrogen-related  water retention, with this hormone actually having a direct effect on the process of anabolism. This is manifest through increases in glucose utilization, growth hormone secretion, and androgen receptor proliferation.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Glucose Utilization and Estrogen</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogen may play a very important role in the promotion of an anabolic state by affecting glucose utilization in muscle tissue. This occurs via an altering of the level of available  glucose  6-phosphate  dehydrogenase,  an enzyme directly tied to the use of glucose for muscle tissue growth and recuperation.<span class="s33">27 28  </span>More specifically, G6PD is a vital part of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is integral in determining the rate nucleic acids and lipids are to be synthesized in cells for tissue repair. During the period of regeneration after skeletal muscle damage, levels of G6PD are shown to rise dramatically, which is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">believed to represent a mechanism for the body to enhance recovery when needed. Surprisingly, we find that estrogen is directly tied to the level of G6PD that is to be made available to cells in this recovery window.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The link between estrogen and G6PD was established in a study  demonstrating  levels  of  this  dehydrogenase enzyme  to  rise  after  administration  of  testosterone propionate. The investigation further showed that the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol was directly responsible for this increase, and not the androgenic action of this steroid.<span class="s33">29  </span>The non-aromatizable steroids dihydrotestosterone  and  fluoxymesterone  were  tested alongside testosterone propionate, but failed to duplicate the effect of testosterone. Furthermore, the positive effect of  testosterone  propionate  was  blocked  when  the aromatase    inhibitor    4-hydroxyandrostenedione (formestane)  was  added,  while  17-beta  estradiol administration alone caused a similar increase in G6PD to testosterone propionate.The inactive estrogen isomer 17- alpha estradiol, which is unable to bind the estrogen receptor,  failed  to  do  anything.  Further  tests  using testosterone propionate and the anti-androgen flutamide showed that this drug also did nothing to block the positive action of testosterone, establishing it as an effect independent of the androgen receptor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark9">Estrogen and GH/IGF-1</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Estrogen  may  also  play  an  important  role  in  the production of growth hormone and IGF-1. IGF-1 (insulin­ like growth factor) is an anabolic hormone released in the liver and various peripheral tissues via the stimulus of growth hormone (See Drug Profiles: Growth Hormone). IGF-1 is responsible for the anabolic activity of growth hormone such as increased nitrogen retention/protein synthesis and cell hyperplasia (proliferation). One of the first studies to bring this issue to our attention looked at the effects of the anti-estrogen tamoxifen on IGF-1 levels, demonstrating it to have a suppressive effect.<span class="s33">30 </span>A second, perhaps more noteworthy, study took place in 1993, which looked at the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on GH and IGF-1 levels alone,and compared them to  the  effects  of  testosterone  combined  again  with tamoxifen.<span class="s33">31 </span>When tamoxifen was given, GH and IGF-1 levels were notably suppressed, while both values were elevated  with  the  administration  of  testosterone enanthate alone. Another study has shown 300 mg of testosterone enanthate weekly to cause a slight IGF-1 increase in normal men. Here the 300 mg of testosterone</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I<span class="s38">                         </span><span class="s39">11</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10">ester caused an elevation of estradiol levels, which would be expected at such a dose. This was compared to the effect of the same dosage of nandrolone decanoate; however, this steroid failed to produce the same increase. This result is quite interesting, especially when we note that estrogen levels were actually lowered</a><span class="s33">32 </span>when this steroid was given. Yet another demonstrated that GH and IGF-1  secretion  is  increased  with  testosterone administration on males with delayed puberty, while dihydrotestosterone   (non-aromatizable)   seems   to suppress GH and IGF-1 secretion.<span class="s33">33</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Estrogen and the Androgen Receptor</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark11">It has also been demonstrated that estrogen can increase the  concentration  of  androgen  receptors  in  certain tissues.This was shown in studies with rats, which looked at the effects of estrogen on cellular androgen receptors in  animals  that  underwent  orchiectomy  (removal  of testes, often done to diminish endogenous androgen production). According to the study, administration of estrogen  resulted  in  a  striking  480%  increase  in methyltrienolone (a potent oral androgen often used to reference receptor binding in studies) binding in the levator ani muscle.</a><span class="s33">34 </span>The suggested explanation is that estrogen must either be directly stimulating androgen receptor production, or perhaps diminishing the rate of receptor breakdown. Although the growth of the levator ani muscle is commonly used as a reference for the anabolic activity of steroid compounds, it is admittedly a sex organ muscle, and different from skeletal muscle tissue in that it possesses a much higher concentration of androgen receptors. This study, however, did look at the effect of estrogen in fast-twitch skeletal muscle tissues (tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus) as well, but did not note the same increase as the levator ani. Although  discouraging  at  first  glance,  the  fact  that estrogen can increase androgen receptor binding in any tissue remains an extremely significant finding, especially in light of the fact that we now know androgens to have some positive effects on muscle growth that are mediated outside of muscle tissue.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Estrogen and Fatigue</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Steroid Fatigue&quot; is a common catchphrase these days, and refers to another important function of estrogen in both the male and female body, namely its ability to promote wakefulness and a mentally alert state. Given the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark12">common   availability   of   potent   third-generation aromatase inhibitors, bodybuilders today are (at times) noticing more extreme estrogen suppression than they had in the past. Often associated with this suppression is fatigue. Under such conditions, the athlete, though on a productive cycle of drugs, may not be able to maximize his or her gains due to an inability to train at full vigor.This effect is sometimes also dubbed &quot;steroid lethargy.&quot; The reason is that estrogen plays an important supporting role in the activity of serotonin. Serotonin is one of the body&#39;s  principle  neurotransmitters,  vital  to  mental alertness and the sleep/wake cycle </a><span class="s33">35 36 </span>Interference with this  neurotransmitter  is  also  associated  with  chronic fatigue syndrome,<span class="s33">37 38 </span>so we can see how vital it is to fatigue specifically. Estrogen suppression in menopause has also been associated with fatigue,<span class="s33">39 </span>as has the clinical use of newer (more potent) aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole,<span class="s33">40 </span>letrozole,<span class="s33">41 </span>exemestane,<span class="s33">42 </span>and fadrozole<span class="s33">43 </span>in some patients. These things may be important to consider when planning your next cycle. Although not everyone notices this problem when estrogen is low, for those that do, a little testosterone or estrogen can go a long way in correcting this. It is also of note that the use of strictly non-aromatizable steroids sometimes causes this effect as well, likely due to the suppression of natural testosterone production (cutting off the main substrate used by the male body to make estrogen).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Antl-Estrogens and the Athlete</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">So what does this all mean to the bodybuilder looking to gain optimal size? Basically <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>think it calls for a cautious approach to the use of estrogen maintenance drugs if mass is the key objective (things change, of course, if we are  talking  about  cutting).  Obviously,  anti-estrogens should be used if there is a clear need for them due to the onset of estrogenic side effects, or at the very least, the drugs being administered should be substituted for non- estrogenic  compounds.  Gynecomastia  is  certainly  an unwanted problem for the steroid user, as are noticeable fat mass gains. But if these problems have not presented themselves, the added estrogen due to a cycle of testosterone or Dianabol, for example, might indeed be aiding in the buildup of muscle mass, or keeping you energetic. An individual confident they will notice, or are not  prone  to  getting,  estrogenic  side  effects,  may therefore want to hold off using estrogen maintenance drugs so as to achieve the maximum possible gains in tissue mass.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">DHT Conversion</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As  we  see  from  our  discussion  with  estrogen,  in considering the physiological effects of any steroid, we must look at all of its active metabolites, and not just the initial  compound.  This  includes  not  only  estrogenic products, but androgenic metabolites as well. With this in mind,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  potency  of testosterone is considerably increased in many androgen responsive   tissues   when   it   converts   to dihydrotestosterone. More commonly referred to by the three-letter abbreviation DHT, this hormone is, in fact, measured  to  be  approximately  three  to  four  times stronger than testosterone. It is the most potent steroid found naturally in the human body, and important to discuss if we are to understand the full activity of testosterone,  as  well  as  other  anabolic/androgenic steroids that undergo a similar conversion.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone upon interaction with the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. More specifically, th is enzyme removes the C4-5 double-bond of testosterone by the addition of two hydrogen atoms to its structure (hence the name di-hydro testosterone). The removal of this bond is important, as in this case it creates a steroid that binds to the androgen receptor much more avidly than its parent steroid. 5-alpha reductase is present in high amounts in tissues of the prostate, skin, scalp, liver, and various regions of the central nervous system, and as such represents a mechanism for the body to increase the potency  of  testosterone  specifically  where  strong androgenic action is needed. In these areas of the body little testosterone will actually make its way to the receptor without being converted to dihydrotestosterone, making DHT by far the active form of androgen here.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark13">DHT and Androgenic Side Effects</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In some regards this local potentiation of testosterone&#39;s activity may be unwelcome, as higher androgenic activity in certain tissues may produce a number of undesirable side effects. Acne, for example, is often triggered by dihydrotestosterone activity in the sebaceous glands, and the local formation of dihydrotestosterone in the scalp is typically blamed for triggering male pattern hair loss. You should know that it is a terrible misconception among bodybuilders  that  dihydrotestosterone  is  an  isolated culprit  when  it  comes  to  these  side  effects.  All anabolic/androgenic steroids exert their activities, both anabolic  and  androgenic,  through  the  same  cellular androgen receptor. Dihydrotestosterone is no different than any other steroid except that it is a more potent activator of this receptor than most, and can be formed</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">locally in certain androgen-sensitive tissues. All steroids can cause androgenic side effects in direct relation to their affinity for this receptor, and DHT has no known unique ability in this regard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark14">Benefits of DHT</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">While a lot of attention is being paid to the negative side effects of the androgen dihydrotestosterone, you should know that there are some known benefits to the strong androgenic activity brought about by this hormone as well. For example, DHT plays an important role in the organization  and  functioning  of  the  central  nervous system.  Many  neural  cells  contain  active  androgen receptors, and it is thought that there may even be a specific importance of dihydrotestosterone in this area of the body. Studies have shown DHT to have a profoundly greater impact in these cells compared to testosterone. More specifically, animal models demonstrated that both testosterone and DHT would result in increased androgen receptor proliferation in neural cells three and seven hours after being administered, however only DHT was able to sustain this increase at the twenty-one hour mark.<span class="s33">44  </span>Although  some  might  contend  that  this difference is simply due to DHT forming a more stable and lasting  complex  with  the  androgen  receptor,  others suggest  that  DHT  and  testosterone  might  even  be affecting  neural  cells  differently,  such  that  the dihydrotestosterone-receptor complex and testosterone- receptor complex might be activating the transcription of different target genes.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  strong  interaction  between  the  central  nervous system and skeletal muscles, collectively referred to as the neuromuscular  system, is of key importance to the athlete.There appears to be little doubt that the ability of the body to adapt to training, and to activate nerve endings in muscle tissue, is reliant on the interactions of the neuromuscular system. Inhibiting the formation of DHT  during  a  testosterone  cycle  may  therefore inadvertently interfere with strength and muscle mass gains. This would explain why bodybuilders commonly report a drop in steroid potency when they add the 5- alpha reductase inhibitor finasteride to a testosterone cycle. Many complain strength and even muscle mass gains slow significantly when this medication is added, which  would  not  make  sense  if  testosterone  and androgen receptor activation in muscle tissue were solely responsible for growth. Clearly more is involved, and we cannot look at dihydrotestosterone simply as a side-effect hormone.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brief History of Anabolic/Androgenic Steroids</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While it had been clear for many centuries that the testicles were crucial for the male body to properly develop,  it  was  not  until  modern  times  that  an understanding of testosterone began to form. The first solid scientific experiments in this area, which eventually led to the discovery and replication of testosterone (and related androgens), were undertaken in the 1800s. During this  century  a  number  of  animal  experiments  were published, most of which involved the removal and/or implantation  of  testicular  material  from/in  a  subject. Although very crude in design by today&#39;s standards, these studies certainly laid the foundation for the modern field of endocrinology (the study of hormones). By the turn of the century, scientists were able to produce the first experimental androgen injections.These were actualized either through the filtering of large quantities of urine (for active hormones), or by extracting testosterone from animal testicles. Again, the methods were rough but the final results proved to be very enlightening.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Chemists finally synthesized the structure of testosterone in the mid-1930&#39;s, sparking a new wave of interest in this hormone.  With  the  medical  community  paying  a tremendous amount of attention to this achievement, the possible therapeutic uses for a readily available synthetic testosterone quickly became an extremely popular focus. Many  believed  the  applications  for  this  type  of  a medication would be extremely far-reaching, with uses ranging from the maintenance of an androgen deficiency, to that of a good health and well-being treatment for the sickly  or  elderly.  During  the  infancy  of  such experimentation, many believed they had crossed paths with a true &quot;fountain of youth.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dihydrotestosterone and nandrolone, two other naturally occurring steroids, were also isolated and synthesized in the early years of steroid development. To make things even more interesting, scientists soon realized that the androgenic, estrogenic, and anabolic activity of steroid hormones could be adjusted by altering their molecular structure.The goal of many researchers thereafter became to manufacture a steroid with extremely strong anabolic</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">activity, but will display little or no androgenic/estrogenic properties. This could be very beneficial, because side effects  will  often  become  pronounced  when  steroid hormones  are  administered  in  supraphysiological amounts. A &quot;pure&quot; anabolic would theoretically allow the patient to receive only the beneficial effects of androgens (lean  muscle  mass  gain,  increased  energy  and recuperation, etc.), regardless of the dosage. Some early success with the creation of new structures convinced many  scientists  that  they  were  on  the  right  track. Unfortunately none of this progress led researchers their ultimate goal. By the mid-1950&#39;s, well over one thousand testosterone,  nandrolone,  and  dihydrotestosterone analogues had been produced, but none proved to be purely anabolic compounds.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The failure to reach this goal was primarily due to an initial flawed understanding of testosterone’s action. Scientists had noticed high levels of DHT in certain tissues, and believed this indicated an unusual receptor affinity for this hormone.This led to the belief that the human body had two  different  androgen  receptors.  According  to  this theory,  one  receptor  site  would  respond  only  to testosterone  (eliciting  the  beneficial  anabolic  effects), while the other is activated specifically by the metabolite, dihydrotestosterone. With this understanding, eliminating the conversion of testosterone to DHT was thought capable of solving the problem of androgenic side effects, as these receptors would have little or none of this hormone available for binding. More recently, however, scientists have come to understand that only one type of androgen receptor exists in the human body. It is also accepted  that  no  anabolic/androgenic  steroid  can possibly be synthesized that would participate only with receptors in tissues related to anabolism. DHT, which was once thought not to bind to the same receptor as testosterone, is now known to do so at approximately three to four times the affinity of its parent, and the unusual recovery of DHT from androgen responsive tissues is now attributed to the distribution characteristics of the 5a-reductase enzyme.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Synthetic AAS Development</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In order to develop products that would be effective therapeutically, chemists needed to solve a number of problems  with  using  natural  steroid  hormones  for treatment. For example, oral dosing was a problem, as our basic   steroids   testosterone,   nandrolone,   and dihydrotestosterone  are  ineffective  when administered this way. The liver would efficiently break down their structure before reaching circulation, so some form of alteration was required in order for a tablet or capsule to be produced. Our natural steroid hormones also have very short half-lives in the body, so when administered by injection,  an  extremely  frequent  and  uncomfortable dosing schedule is required if a steady blood level is to be achieved. Therefore, extending steroid activity was a major goal for many chemists during the early years of synthetic AAS development.Scientists also focused on the nagging problems of possible excess estrogenic buildup in the blood, particularly with testosterone, which can become  very  uncomfortable  for  patients  undergoing therapy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark15">Methylated Compounds and Oral Dosing</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chemists realized that by replacing the hydrogen atom at the steroid’s 17th alpha position with a carbon atom (a process referred to as <i><b>alkylation), </b></i>its structure would be notably resistant to breakdown by the liver. The carbon atom is typically added in the form of a methyl group</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">including  methyltestosterone,  Dianabol,  Winstrol®, Anadrol 50®, Halotestin®, Nilevar, Orabolin, and Anavar. The principle drawback to these compounds is that they place a notable amount of stress on the liver, which in some instances can lead to actual damage to this organ.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Because the alkyl group cannot be removed, it mediates the action of the steroid in the body. Methyltestosterone, for  example,  is  not  simply  an  oral  equivalent  of testosterone, as the added alkylation changes the activity of this steroid considerably. One major change we see is an  increased  tendency  for  the  steroid  to  produce estrogenic side effects, despite the fact that it actually lowers  the  ability  of  the  hormone  to  interact  with aromatase.<span class="s33">45 </span>Apparently with 17-alkylation present on a steroid, aromatization (when possible) produces a more active  form  of  estrogen  (typically  17alpha-methyl  or 17alpha-ethyl  estradiol).  These  estrogens  are  more biologically active than estradiol due to their longer half­ life and weaker tendency to bind with serum proteins. In some instances, 17alpha-alkylation will also enhance the ability of the initial steroid compound to bind with and activate the estrogen or progesterone receptor.<span class="s33">46  </span>An enhancement of estrogenic properties is also obvious when  we  look  at  methandrostenolone,  which  is  an alkylated form of boldenone (Equipoise®), and Nilevar, which  is  an  alkylated  form  of  the  mild  anabolic nandrolone. Dianabol is clearly more estrogenic than</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="221" height="139" alt="image" src="img/Image_004.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="265" height="137" alt="image" src="img/Image_005.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">(CH3), although we see oral steroids with an added ethyl (C2H5) grouping as well. A steroid with this alteration is commonly described as a C-17 alpha alkylated oral, although the terms methylated or ethylated oral steroid are also used. The alkyl group cannot be removed metabolically, and therefore inhibits reduction of the steroid to its inactive 17-ketosteroid form by occupying one  of  the  necessary  carbon  bonds.  Before  long, pharmaceutical companies had utilized this advance (and others) to manufacture an array of effective oral steroids</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Equipoise®, a drug not noted for producing strong side effects of this nature. The same holds true for the comparison of Nilevar to Deca-Durabolin, a compound that we also know to be extremely mild in this regard.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">C17 alpha alkylation also typically lowers the affinity in which the steroid binds to the androgen receptor, as is noted with the weak relative binding affinity of such popular agents as Dianabol and Winstrol (stanozolol). However, since this alteration also greatly prolongs the</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">half-life of a steroid, as well as increases the tendency for it to exist in an unbound state, it creates a more potent anabolic/androgenic agent in both cases. This explains why Dianabol and stanozolol are notably effective in relatively lower weekly doses (often 140 mg weekly will produce notable growth) compared to injectables such as testosterone and nandrolone, which often need to reach doses of 300-400 mg weekly for a similar level of effect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark16">Non-Alkylated Opals</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In an attempt to solve the mentioned problems with liver toxicity we see with c17-alpha alkylated compounds, a number of other orals with different chemical alterations (such  as  Primobolan®,  Proviron®,  AndriolE,  and Anabolicum  Vister)  were  created.  Primobolan®  and Proviron® are alkylated at the one position (methyl), a trait which also slows ketosteroid reduction. Andriol&quot; uses a 17beta  carboxylic  acid  ester  (used  with  injectable compounds, discussed below), however, here the oil- dissolved steroid is sealed in a capsule and is intended for oral administration. This is supposed to promote steroid absorption through intestinal lymphatic ducts, bypassing the  first  pass  through  the  liver.  In  addition  to  1 methylation, Primobolan® also utilizes a 17 beta ester (acetate) to further protect against reduction to inactive form (here there is no lymphatic system absorption). Anabolicum Vister uses 17beta enol ether linkage to protect the steroid, which is very similar to esterification as the ether breaks off to release a steroid base (boldenone in this case). While all of these types of compounds do not place the same stress on the liver, they are also much less resistant to breakdown than 17 alkylated orals, and are ultimately less active milligram for milligram.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark17">Esteps and Injectable Compounds</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="336" height="25" alt="image" src="img/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">You may notice that many injectable steroids will list long chemical  names  like  testosterone  cypionate  and testosterone enanthate, instead of just testosterone. In these cases, the cypionate and enanthate are esters (carboxylic acids) that have been attached to the 17-beta</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">hydroxyl  group  of  the  testosterone  molecule,  which increase the active life span of the steroid preparation. Such alterations will reduce the steroid&#39;s level of water solubility, and increase its oil solubility. Once an esterified compound has been injected, it will form a deposit in the muscle tissue (depot) from which it will slowly enter circulation. Generally the larger the ester chain, the more oil soluble the steroid compound will be, and the longer it will take for the full dosage to be released. Once free in circulation, enzymes will quickly remove the ester chain and the parent hormone will be free to exert its activity (while the ester is present the steroid is inert).</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There are a wide number of esters, which can provide varying release times, used in medicine today.To compare, an ester like decanoate can extend the release of active parent drug into the blood stream for three to four weeks, while it may only be extended for a few days with an acetate or propionate ester.The use of an ester allows for a much less frequent injection schedule than if using a water-based (straight) testosterone, which is much more comfortable for the patient. We must remember when calculating dosages, that the ester is figured into the steroid&#39;s  measured  weight.  100  mg  of  testosterone enanthate, therefore, contains much less base hormone than 100 mg of a straight testosterone suspension (in this case it equals 72mg of testosterone). In some instances, an ester may account for roughly 40% or more of the total steroid weight, but the typical measure is somewhere around 15% to 35%. Below are the free base equivalents for several popular steroid compounds.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is also important to stress the fact that esters do not alter the activity of the parent steroid in any way. They work only to slow its release. It is quite common to hear people speak about the properties of different esters, almost  as  if  they  can  magically  alter  a  steroid&#39;s effectiveness. This is really nonsense. Enanthate is not more powerful than cypionate (perhaps a few extra milligrams of testosterone released per injection, but nothing to note), nor is Sustanon some type of incredible testosterone blend.

Your  muscle  cells  see  only testosterone; ultimately there is no difference. Reports of varying levels of muscle gain, androgenic side effects, water retention, etc. are only issues of timing. Faster- releasing  testosterone  esters  will  produce  estrogen buildup faster simply because there is more testosterone free in the blood from the start of the cycle. The same is true  when  we  state  that  Durabolin®  is  a  milder nandrolone for women compared to Deca. It is simply easier to control the blood level with a faster acting drug. Were  virilization  symptoms  to  become  apparent, hormone levels will drop much faster once we stop administration. This should not be confused with the notion that the nandrolone in Durabolin® acts differently in the body than that released from a shot of Deca- Durabolin®.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark18">It is also worth noting that while the ester is typically hydrolyzed in general circulation, some will </a><span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>hydrolyzed at the injection site where the steroid depot first contacts blood. This will cause a slightly higher concentration of both free steroid and ester in the muscle where the drug had been administered. On the plus side, this may equate to slightly better growth in this muscle, as more hormone is made available to nearby ceils. Many bodybuilders have come to swear by the use of injection sites such as the deltoids, biceps, and triceps, truly believing better growth can be achieved if the steroid is injected directly into these muscles.The negative to this is that the ester itself may be irritating to the tissues at the site of injection once it is broken free. In some instances it can be so caustic that the muscle itself will become swollen and sore due to the presence of the ester, and the user may even suffer a low- grade fever as the body fights off the irritant (the onset of such  symptoms  typically  occurs  24-72  hours  after injection). This effect is more common with small chain esters such as propionate and acetate, and can actually make a popular steroid such as Sustanon (which contains testosterone propionate) off-limits for some users who experience too much discomfort to justify using the drug. Longer chain esters such as decanoate and cypionate are typically much less irritating at the site of injection, and therefore are preferred by sensitive individuals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/Andr ogenic Dissociation</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although never complete, scientists had some success in their quest to separate the androgenic and anabolic properties  of  testosterone.  A  number  of  synthetic anabolic steroids had been developed as a result, with many being notably weaker and stronger than our base androgen. In order to first assess the anabolic and androgenic potential of each newly developed steroid, scientists had generally used rats as a model. To judge</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">androgenic potency the typical procedure involved the post-administration measure <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(% </span>growth) of the seminal vesicles and ventral prostate.These two tissues will often respond unequally to a given steroid, however, so an average of the two figures is used. Anabolic activity was most commonly determined by measuring the growth of the levator ani, a sex organ (not skeletal) muscle. This tissue may not be the most ideal one to use though, as it contains more androgen receptor than most skeletal muscles (the AR is still less abundant here than in target tissues such as the ventral prostate).<span class="s33">47 48 </span>In integrating both measures, the anabolic index is used, which relates the ratio of anabolic to androgenic response for a given steroid. An anabolic index greater than one indicates a higher  tendency  for  anabolic  effect,  and  therefore classifies the drug as an anabolic steroid. A measure lower than one in turn assesses the steroid as androgenic.There is some variance between experimental results and the actual real world experiences with humans, but (with a few exceptions) designations based on the anabolic index are generally accepted. Below are discussed a few factors that greatly affect anabolic/androgenic dissociation.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark19">Nandrolone and 19 norandrogens</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The section of this book dealing with DHT conversion is important, because it helps us understand the anabolic steroid  nandrolone  and  many  of  its  derivatives. Nandrolone is identical to testosterone except it lacks a carbon atom in the 19th position, hence its other given name 19-nortestosterone. Nandrolone is very interesting because  it  offers  the  greatest  ratio  of  anabolic  to androgenic effect of the three natural steroids (see: Synthetic AAS Chemistry).This is because it is metabolized into  a  less  potent  structure  (dihydronandrolone)  in androgen target tissues with high concentrations of the 5- alpha reductase enzyme, which is the exact opposite of what happens with testosterone. Apparently the removal of the c4-5 double bond, which normally increases the androgen  receptor  binding  capability  of  testosterone, causes  an  unusual  lowering  of  this  ability  with nandrolone. Instead of becoming three to four times more potent, it becomes several times weaker. This is a very desirable trait if you want to target anabolic effects over androgenic. This characteristic also carries over to most synthetic steroids derived from nandrolone, making this an attractive base steroid to use in the synthesis of new, primarily anabolic, steroids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark20">S-alpha Irreducible Steroids</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When we look at the other mild anabolic steroids Primobolan®, Winstrol®, and Anavar, none of which are derived from nandrolone, we see another interesting</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21">commonality. These steroids are DHT derivatives that are unaffected by 5alpha-reductase, and therefore become neither weaker nor stronger In androgen responsive target tissues with high concentrations of this enzyme. In essence,they have a very balanced effect between muscle and  androgen  tissues,  making  them  outwardly  less androgenic than testosterone. This is why these steroids are technically classified as anabolics, and are undeniably less troublesome than many other steroids in terms of promoting androgenic side effects. However, if we wanted to look for the absolute least androgenic steroid, the title would still go to nandrolone (or perhaps one of its derivatives). Female bodybuilders should likewise take note that despite the recommendations of others, steroids like Anavar, Winstrol and Primo are not the least risky steroids to use. This is of great importance, as male sex hormones can produce many undesirable and permanent side effects when incorrectly taken by females (See: Side Effects,Virilization).</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">3-alpha Hydroxysleroid Dehydrogenase</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme is also important, because it can work to reduce the anabolic potency of certain steroids considerably. As follows, not all potent binders of the androgen receptor are, as a rule, great muscle-building drugs, and this enzyme is an important factor. Dihydrotestosterone is a clear example.

This is accomplished by the rapid reduction of DHT to its inactive active  metabolites,  namely  androstanediol,  before  it reaches the androgen receptor. This activity occurs via interaction   with   the   3-alpha   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme. This enzyme is present in high concentrations  in  certain  tissues,  including  skeletal muscle, and DHT is much more open to alteration by it than other steroids that possess a c4-5 double-bond (like testosterone).<span class="s33">49 </span>This causes dihydrotestosterone to be an extremely poor anabolic, despite the fact that it actually exhibits a much higher affinity for the cellular androgen receptor than most other steroids. Were it able to reach the  cellular  androgen  receptor  without  first  being metabolized by 3a-HSD, it certainly would be a formidable muscle-building steroid. Unfortunately this is not the case, explaining   why   injectable   dihydrotestosterone preparations (no longer commercially produced) were never favorite drugs among athletes looking to build mass.This trait is also shared by the currently popular oral androgen Proviron®, which is, in essence, just an oral form of DHT (1-methyl dihydrotestosterone to be specific) and known to be an extremely poor tissue builder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark22">Anabolics and Potency</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">One must remember that being classified as an anabolic just means that the steroid is more inclined to produce muscle growth than androgenic side effects.

If we are just looking at overall muscle growth, androgenic steroids (usually potent due to their displaying a high affinity to bind with the androgen receptor in all tissues) are typically much more productive muscle-builders than anabolics, which usually bind with lower affinity in many tissues. In fact, with all of the analogues produced throughout the years, the base androgen testosterone is still considered to be one of the most effective bulking agents. The user must simply endure more side effects when acquiring his or her new muscle with this type of drug. Individuals wishing to avoid the stronger steroids will, therefore, make a trade-off, accepting less overall muscle gain in order to run a more comfortable cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark23">RBA Assay:</a></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Another way of evaluating the potential ratio of anabolic</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">to androgenic activity is the practice of comparing the relative binding affinity (RBA) of various steroids for the androgen receptor in rat skeletal muscle versus prostate. When we look at the detailed study published in 1984, we see some recognizable (and expected) trends. Aside from dihydrotestosterone and Proviron® (mesterolone), which undergo rapid enzymatic reduction in muscle tissue to inactive metabolites, the remaining anabolic/androgenic steroids seem to bind with near equal affinity to receptors in both tissues. They seem to be relatively &quot;balanced&quot; in effect. This study also discusses the unique activity of testosterone  and  nandrolone  compounds,  which  are good substrates for the Sa-reductase enzyme found in androgen target tissues (such as the prostate), and seem to provide the most notable variance between anabolic and androgenic effect in humans due to this local metabolism. When it comes to real-world use in humans, anabolic  steroids  do  not  always  behave  in  100% uniformity with their anabolic and androgenic profiles as determined by animal models, so all such figures need to be taken with a small grain of salt.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Synthetic AAS Chemistry</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 194pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="175" height="105" alt="image" src="img/Image_007.png"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Steran Nucleus</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 180pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">(All natural and synthetic AAS hormones share this base structure)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s45" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="174" height="133" alt="image" src="img/Image_008.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="173" height="135" alt="image" src="img/Image_009.gif"/></span><span class="s40">	</span><span><img width="173" height="133" alt="image" src="img/Image_010.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids are preparations containing one of the above three natural steroid hormones, or chemically altered derivativesthereof. In creating new synthetic compounds, one of the three natural hormones is selected as a starting point, typically due to the possession of particular traits that may be beneficial for the new compound. For instance, of the three natural steroids above, dihydrotestosterone is the only steroid devoid of the possibility of aromatization and 5-alpha reduction. It was likewise a very popular choice in the creation of synthetics that lack estrogenic activity and/or exhibit a more balanced androgenic to anabolic activity ratio. Nandroione was typically used when even lower androgenic action is desired, due to its weakening upon interaction with the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. Nandroione also aromatizes much more slowly than testosterone. Testosterone is our most powerful muscle-building hormone, and also exhibits strong androgenic activity due to its conversion to a more potent steroid (dihydrotestosterone) via 5-alpha reductase.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">Testosterone derivatives</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="173" height="115" alt="image" src="img/Image_011.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Boldenone (+d-2 double bond)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="177" height="114" alt="image" src="img/Image_012.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Methyltestosterone (+ 17alpha methyl)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone is testosterone with an added double-bond between carbon atoms one and two. However, this bond changes the activity of the steroid considerably. First, it dramatically slows aromatization, such that boldenone converts to estradiol at about half the rate of testosterone. Secondly, this bond causes the steroid to be a very poor substrate for the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. The more active 5-alpha reduced metabolite Salpha-dihydroboldenone is produced only in very small amounts in humans.The hormone instead tends to convert via 5-beta reductase to 5beta-dihydroboldenone (a virtually inactive androgenj.This makes it lean towards being an anabolic instead of an androgen, although both traits are still notably apparent with this steroid.The d -2 double bond also slows the hepatic breakdown of the structure, increasing its resistance to 17-ketosteroid deactivation and its functional half-life and oral bioavailability.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">This is the most basic derivative of testosterone, differing only by the added 17- alpha methylation that makes the steroid orally active. Conversion to 17-alpha methylestradiol makes this steroid extremely estrogenic, despite the fact that this alteration actually reduces interaction with the aromatase enzyme.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="177" height="115" alt="image" src="img/Image_013.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: center;">Methandrostenolone (+c 1-2 double bond; 17-alpha methyl)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In many regards, methandrostenolone is very similar to boldenone, as it too exhibits reduced estrogenic and androgenic activity due to the cl-2 double-bond. However, this steroid does have a reputation of being somewhat estrogenic, owing to the fact that it converts to a highly active form of estrogen (17alpha- methylestradiol See:Methylated Compounds and Oral Dosing). Methandrostenolone is also much more active milligram for milligram, as the 17-alpha methyl group also gives it a longer half-life and allows it to exist in a more free state than its cousin boldenone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="179" height="115" alt="image" src="img/Image_014.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Fluoxymesterone</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">(+11-beta hydroxyl; 9-fluoro; 17-alpha methyl)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone is a c-17alpha alkylated oral derivative of testosterone. The 11- beta group functions to inhibit aromatization, so there is no estrogen conversion at all with this steroid. It also works to lower the affinity of this steroid toward restrictive serum binding proteins, increasing its relative activity. Introduction of fluorine at the 9-position also potentiates the action of this steroid.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark25">Nandrolone derivatives</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="188" height="154" alt="image" src="img/Image_015.gif"/></span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norethandrolone is simply nandrolone with an added 17-alpha ethyl group. This alteration is rarely used with anabolic/androgenic steroids, and is much more commonly found with synthetic estrogens and progestins. Although 17-ethylation inhibits 17-ketosteroid reduction just as well as 17-methylation, and therefore allows this steroid to exhibit a similarly high level of oral activity, this group also tends to increase progesterone receptor binding. Norethandrolone is clearly a &quot;troublesome&quot; hormone in terms of water retention, fat gain, and gynecomastia, which may in part be due to its heightened binding to this receptor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="166" height="103" alt="image" src="img/Image_016.gif"/></span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">OH</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s47" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 21pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Ethylestrenol (+17alpha-ethyl;- 3-Keto)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol is an oral derivative of nandrolone, very similar in structure to norethandrolone. In fact, it differs from this steroid only by the removal of the 3- keto group, which is vital to androgen receptor binding. As such, ethylestrenol is possibly the weakest steroid milligram for milligram ever sold commercially. Any activity this steroid does exhibit is likely from its conversion to norethandrolone, which does seem to occur with some affinity (apparently the 3 oxygen group is metabolically added to this compound without much troublej.This is probably the most interesting trait of ethylestrenol, which is an undistinguished compound otherwise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="173" height="106" alt="image" src="img/Image_017.gif"/></span></p><p class="s47" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Trenbolone</p><p class="s47" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">(+ c9-10 double bond; cl 1-12 double bond)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although a derivative of nandrolone, the two additional double-bonds present on trenbolone make any similarities to its parent hormone extremely difficult to see. First, the 9-10 bond inhibits aromatization. Nandrolone is very slowly aromatized, however, some estrogen is still produced from this steroid. Not so with trenbolone. The 11-12 bond additionally increases androgen receptor binding.This steroid also does not undergo 5-alpha reduction like nandrolone, and as such does not share the same dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects (trenbolone is much more androgenic in comparison).</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">Dihydrotestosterone derivatives</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="173" height="114" alt="image" src="img/Image_018.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mesterolone (+ 1-methyl)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Mesterolone is a potent orally active derivative of dihydrotestosterone. Similar to methenolone, it possesses a non-toxic 1-methyl group, which increases its resistance to hepatic breakdown. This alteration does not increase the stability of the 3-keto group however, and as such, this steroid is a poor anabolic like its parent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="174" height="114" alt="image" src="img/Image_019.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Drostanolone (+ 2-methyl)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone is simply dihydrotestosterone with an added 2-methyi group.

We do know that this group greatly enhances anabolic potency by increasing the stability of the 3-keto group, and that the configuration of this substituent also appears to allow this steroid to bind and activate the estrogen receptor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="115" alt="image" src="img/Image_021.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Stanozolol</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">(+ 3,2 pyrazol; 17-alpha methyl)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol is a potent anabolic steroid, owing to the fact that the 3-2 pyrazol group creates a stable configuration off the A-ring that allows for androgen receptor binding (this steroid is one of the few that does not possess an actual 3-keto group).

It also differs from DHT by the substitution of its 2-carbon molecule with oxygen.This is the only commercial steroid to carry this group, and further, the only to have a modification to the base carbon structure of the Steran nucleus,The 2-oxo group increases resistance of the 3-keto group to metabolism considerably, making oxandrolone a potent anabolic.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Steroid Nomenclature</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps not obvious at first glance, there is a naming convention in place that was used to create identities for the various anabolic/androgenic steroid hormones. This typically involves forming a root word to convey the structural base of the steroid, and signifying other unique structural characteristics by including appropriate prefixes or suffixes. Below, we will look at the common roots, prefixes, and suffixes used in steroid nomenclature, and identify them, as they are used in the various commercial compound names. As you will see, the adoption of names like nandroione, methandrostenolone,and ethylestrenol were not as arbitrary as one might imagine.This section is also helpful if you wish to understand the deeper chemical designations for the various substances that one might find in the medical literature, which involve the exclusive use of this terminology (such as is the representation of methandrostenolone as 17b-hydroxy-17a-methylandrosta-1, 4-dien-3-one).</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Common prefixes and suffixes used in steroid naming:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.75pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:112pt"><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s48" style=" background-color: #FCFCFC;">Structural   Property    </span></p></td><td style="width:118pt"><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Prefix</p></td><td style="width:63pt"><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Suffix</p></td></tr><tr style="height:12pt"><td style="width:112pt"><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Carbonyl (C=O)</p></td><td style="width:118pt"><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">oxo-;

Having been applied for many decades to treat a variety of diseased states, today these drugs have a number of well-established medical uses. They have  been  used  to  treat  most  patient  populations, including men and women of almost all ages, ranging from  children  to  the  elderly.  In  many  instances anabolic/androgenic  steroids  have  proven  to  be  life saving medications, which is a fact easily overlooked with all of the discussion about steroid abuse. This section details some of the most common and accepted medical applications for anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Androgen Replacement Therapy/Hypogonadlsm</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  most  widely  used  medical  application  for anabolic/androgenic  steroids  in  the  world  is  that  of androgen  replacement  therapy.  Also  referred  to  as Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), this therapy involves the supplementation  of  the  primary  male  hormone testosterone to alleviate symptoms of low hormone levels (clinically referred to as hypogonadism). Patients may be adolescent   males   suffering   from   childhood hypogonadism  or  a  specific  disorder  that  causes androgenic hormone disruption, although most of the treated population consists of adult men over the age of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">30. In most cases hormone levels have declined in these men as a result of the normal aging process.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  most  common  complaints  associated  with  low testosterone in adult men include reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of energy, decreased strength and/or endurance,  reduced  ability  to  play  sports,  mood fluctuations, reduced height (bone loss), reduced work performance, memory loss, and muscle loss.<span class="s33">50  </span>When associated with aging, these symptoms are collectively placed under the label of&quot;andropause&#39;.&#39;ln a clinical setting this disorder is referred to as late-onset hypogonadism. Blood testosterone levels below 350ng/dL are usually regarded  as  clinically  significant,  although  some physicians will use a level as low as 200ng/dL as the threshold for normal. Hypogonadism is, unfortunately,still widely under-diagnosed. Most physicians will also not recommend treatment  for low testosterone unless a patient is complaining about symptoms (symptomatic androgen deficiency).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Androgen replacement therapy effectively alleviates most</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">symptoms of low testosterone levels. To begin with, raising testosterone levels above 350ng/dL (the very low end of the normal range) will often restore normal sexual function and libido in men with dysfunctions related to hormone  insufficiency.  With  regard  to  bone  mineral density,  hormone  replacement  therapy  is  also documented to have a significant positive effect. For example, studies administering 250 mg of testosterone enanthate every 21 days showed a 5% increase in bone mineral density after six months.<span class="s33">51 </span>Over time this may prevent some loss of height and bone strength with aging, and may also reduce the risk of fracture. Hormone replacement  therapy  also  increases  red  blood  cell concentrations  (oxygen  carrying  capacity),  improving energy and sense of well-being.Therapy also supports the retention of lean body mass, and improves muscle strength and endurance.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Unlike steroid abuse, hormone replacement therapy may have benefits with regard to cardiovascular disease risk. For example, studies tend to show hormone replacement as having a positive effect on serum lipids.This includes a reduction in LDL and total cholesterol levels, combined with no significant change in HDL (good) cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">52 53 </span>Testosterone supplementation also reduces midsection obesity, and improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic  control.<span class="s33">54  </span>These  are  important  factors  in metabolic syndrome, which may also be involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Additionally, testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to improve the profile of inflammatory markers TNF-, IL-1 „ and IL-10.<span class="s33">55 </span>The reduced inflammation may help protect arterial walls from degeneration by plaque and scar tissue.The medical consensus today appears to be that replacement therapy in otherwise healthy men generally does not have a negative effect on cardiovascular disease risk, and may actually decrease certain risk factors for the disease in some patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There are some concerns with initiating testosterone replacement therapy when the individual is in poor health. One study examined the safety of HRT in men aged 65 and older with limited mobility and various health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia<span class="s33">56  </span>Each subject took a transdermal testosterone gel (Wg/IOOmg) or placebo gel daily for six months.

Another  study  with  middle-aged</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">hypogonadal men found that testosterone replacement therapy  (testosterone  enanthate  250mg/2  weeks) reduced  vascular  reactivity,  an  important  factor  in atherosclerosis.<span class="s33">57 </span>These studies suggest that care should be taken when considering HRT in men with heart disease, strong contributing factors to heart disease, or other chronic health conditions.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There are other areas of concern with elderly patients.To begin  with,  testosterone  administration  may  increase prostate volume and PSA values.<span class="s33">58 59 </span>While this does not appear to be of clinical significance with normal healthy patients,  benign  prostate  hypertrophy  and  prostate cancer can be stimulated by testosterone. Men with prostate cancer, high PSA values, or breast cancer are generally  not  prescribed  testosterone.  Androgen supplementation has also been linked to sleep apnea, which can interfere with the most restful (REM) phase of sleep.<span class="s33">60  </span>The studies have produced conflicting data, however,  and  the  potential  relationship  remains  the subject  of  much  debate.<span class="s33">61   </span>Lastly,  testosterone replacement  therapy  has  demonstrated  negative, positive, and neutral effects on cognitive functioning in elderly men.<span class="s33">62 63 64 </span>Studies do suggest that the dose can dictate the level of response, with the most positive effects noted when the androgen level reaches the mid- to  upper-range  of  normal,  not  supraphysiological.<span class="s33">65 </span>Elderly  patients  with  preexisting  deficits  in  cognitive function should have their cognitive performance and blood hormone levels monitored closely during hormone replacement therapy.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Common Treatment Protocols:</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Transdermal<span class="p">:  Transdermal  application  is  the  most commonly  prescribed  method  for  supplementing testosterone in the United States and Canada, and is generally  the  first  course  of  therapy  initiated  with androgen replacement therapy patients. This method of drug delivery offers a number of advantages to the patient  when  compared  to  injection.  Since  the transdermal application is painless, patient compliance and comfort is increased in comparison. Transdermal application  also  provides  stable  day-to-day  hormone levels, and does not produce the broad fluctuations usually noticed with injectable testosterone esters. The most common protocol among hormone replacement doctors is to prescribe a dosage of 2.5-10 mg of testosterone per day (approximate absorbed dose).This is applied as a rub-on gel or adhesive transdermal patch that is replaced daily. Note that due to metabolism in the skin, transdermal application of testosterone tends to increase serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels more profoundly  than  testosterone  injection.  This  may</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">exacerbate androgenic side effects during therapy in some patients, causing some to seek out injectable forms of testosterone as an alternative.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Injection<span class="p">:  Testosterone  enanthate  and  testosterone cypionate are the most widely prescribed injectable testosterone drugs in the United States and Canada. In many other markets the blended ester products Sustanon</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">100 and Sustanon 250 are also commonly prescribed. Injection of one of these testosterone ester products will provide the patient supplemental androgen levels for approximately 2 to 3 weeks after each application. The most common protocol among hormone replacement doctors is to administer 200 mg of testosterone enanthate or cypionate once every 2 to 3 weeks. It is important to remember that testosterone esters will deliver varying levels of testosterone to the body on a day-to-day basis throughout  each  application  window.  Levels  will  be highest the first several days after injection, and will slowly decline to baseline over the following weeks. Physicians are usually encouraged to monitor their patients closely to  ensure  androgen  supplementation  is  sustaining hormone levels within the normal range (and alleviating symptoms  of  hypogonadism)  throughout  the  entire therapeutic  period.  The  longer  acting  injectable testosterone   preparation   Nebido   (testosterone undecanoate) is undergoing review in the U.S., and has already been approved in other markets. This drug requires only 4 to 5 injections per year for most patients.</p><p class="s49" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Oral<span class="p">: Testosterone undecanoate (Andrioi) is the only prescription medication that delivers testosterone via an oral capsule. This medication is not approved for sale in the United States, but is a prescription drug in Canada and many other markets around the world. Patient compliance and comfort are high with this form of therapy, as there are no special routines or requirements aside from taking a few capsules each day with meals. Oral testosterone undecanoate is usually given at an initial dosage of 120 to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">160 mg per day, which equates to three to four 40 mg capsules. This dosage may be reduced in subsequent weeks to 120 mg per day. The capsules are given in two divided doses per day, which are usually taken with breakfast and dinner. While this form of therapy is highly convenient, serum hormone levels can fluctuate greatly on a day-to-day basis. The amount of fat consumption has a particularly strong impact on hormone bioavailability, and meals providing at least 20 grams of fat are recommended when taking the capsules for maximum absorption. Note that as with transdermal testosterone, oral testosterone undecanoate tends to increase serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels more profoundly than testosterone injections.</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">Angioedema, Hereditary</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic  steroids  are  commonly  prescribed  for  the treatment  of  hereditary  angioedema,  a  rare  and potentially  life-threatening  disorder  of  the  immune system. Hereditary angioedema is caused by genetic mutations of blood clotting factors, characterized by a decrease in the level or functioning of the protein C1 esterase inhibitor. This protein controls C1, which is a &quot;complement system&quot; protein that plays an important role In the control of inflammation. Symptoms of hereditary angioedema include an intermittent but rapid swelling of the hands, arms, legs, lips, eyes, tongue, or throat. Swelling may also be noticed in the digestive tract, resulting in abdominal cramping, nausea, or vomiting. In the most serious cases, the patient may notice a swelling of the throat and a blockage of the airway passages, resulting in asphyxiation and sydden death. Many attacks occur without a specific trigger, although stress,trauma, surgery, and  dental  work  are  commonly  associated  with angioedema attacks.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Oral c-17 alpha alkylated anabolic/androgenic steroids have been shown to be a useful form of preventive therapy, stabilizing complement system protein levels and reducing the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks.<span class="s33">66 </span>They are usually administered in a low dose, which is to betaken for long-term support of this disorder. The anabolic steroids that have been most commonly used in the United States for this purpose are stanozolol and danocrine, although historically many other agents have  also  been  prescribed  including  oxandrolone, methyltestosterone, oxymethoIone, fluoxymesterone, and methandrostenolone. The amount of steroid needed can vary  depending  on  the  individual,  and  is  usually maintained at the lowest therapeutically effective dosage in an effort to offset undesirable side effects. FDA approved   prescribing   guidelines   for   stanozolol recommended an initial dosage of 2 mg three times daily (6 mg per day). This would be slowly adjusted downward to a maintenance level after a positive response was noted, usually to 2 mg given once every 1 to 2 days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark31">Anemia</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As a ciass of drugs, anabolic/androgenic steroids stimulate the synthesis of erythropoietin in the kidneys, a hormone that supports the manufacture of new red blood cells. By doing this, the administration of steroids tends to increase the red cell count and hematocrit level, making them of tangible therapeutic value for treating certain forms of anemia (a disease characterized by insufficient red blood cell production). Forms of anemia likely to respond to steroid  therapy  include  anemias  caused  by  renal insufficiency,  sickle  cell  anemia,  refractory  anemias</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">including aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis, myelosclerosis, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, and anemias caused by malignancy or myelotoxic drugs.The level of response will vary depending on the patient, type of therapy, and form of anemia, but in many cases the management of a normal hematocrit level can be achieved.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In the United States, both oxymethoIone (Anadrol 50) and nandrolone decanoate (Deca-Durabolin) are approved by the  FDA  for  the  treatment  of  severe  anemia.  The guidelines for using oxymethoIone with both male and female anemic patients (children and adults) recommend a dosage of 1-2 mg/kg/per day. This would equate to a daily dosage of 75-150 mg for an individual weighing about 160 lbs. Doses as high as 5 mg/kg/day are sometimes necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic response.  The  guidelines  for  nandrolone  decanoate recommend a dosage of 50-100 mg per week for women and 100-200 mg per week for men. Children (2 to 13 years of age) are recommended a dosage of 25- 50 mg every 3 to 4 weeks.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark32">In recent years, the advent of recombinant erythropoietin as a prescription drug has changed the face of anemia treatment  considerably.  While  anabolic/androgenic steroids still offer therapeutic value here, and are still marketed and sold to treat anemic patients, they are presently regarded as adjunct or fallback medications for use only when therapy with an erythropoietin alone has failed to achieve a desired response. The hematocrit increase from anabolic/androgenic steroids is generally less  predictable  and  positive  than  the  newer erythropoietins, and these drugs also tend to produce very noticeable side effects when given in the levels necessary  to  stimulate  erythropoiesis,  especially  in women and children. In many instances the risks to therapy   strongly   outweigh   the   benefits   of anabolic/androgenic steroids, given that there are newer and directly targeted medications available with much lower side effect potential.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Breast Cancer</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids are sometimes prescribed to treat beast cancer in postmenopausal women or premenopausal  women  who  have  had  thetr  ovaries removed. These drugs are of value when the cancer is hormone responsive, which means that its growth can be affected  (positively  or  negatively)  by  hormonal manipulation. Androgens and estrogens have opposing actions on hormone-responsive tumors, with estrogens supporting  the  growth  of  breast  cancer  tissue  and androgens inhibiting it<span class="s50">67</span>. The supplementation of an anabolic/androgenic steroid can shift the androgen to estrogen balance in a direction that favors a reduction in</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">tumor size, a therapy that has elicited a successful response in a fair number of patients. The masculinizing side effects of steroid therapy can be very pronounced in women, however, so therapy is usually initiated with great caution. An oral androgen such as fluoxymesterone is usually preferred to a slower acting injectable steroid such as nandrolone decanoate as well, as it can be abruptly halted if undesirable side effects become too apparent. Both primarily anabolic agents, however, have been widely prescribed for this purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In recent years the development of newer and more targeted anti-estrogenic drugs such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibiting drugs have almost completely eliminated the use of anabolic/androgenic steroids for breast cancer treatment. Medicative treatment for breast cancer today usually consists of a SERM like Nolvadex (tamoxifen), which may be used with a strong aromatase inhibitor such as Arimidex  (anastrozole)  or  Ferna  ra  (exemestane). Anabolic/androgenic steroids are still made available in the United States and many other nations for treating breast cancer, and are sometimes still applied. They are very much regarded as adjunct or fallback medications, however, for use only when therapy with anti-estrogenic drugs alone has failed to achieve a desired response.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark33">Decreased Fibrinolytic Activity</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic steroids may be prescribed to treat conditions associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity. Fibrinolysis is the process in which a blood clot is broken down and metabolized by the body. It represents a counter to blood coagulation, with the two systems working together to maintain  the  hemostatic  balance.  Disorders  of  the fibrinolytic system are rare, although can be very serious in nature when they do occur. Decreased fibrinolytic activity can result in a shift in blood clotting factors that greatly favor coagulation (hypercoagulability), increasing the risk of a serious cardiovascular event such as thromboembolism, heart attack, or stroke. Oral C-17 alpha alkylated anabolic steroids are recognized to increase fibrinolytic activity, and as a result have been beneficial in many  patients  suffering  from  decreased  fibrinolytic activity linked to Antithrombin III deficiency or fibrinogen excess.<span class="s33">68 69 </span>Stanozolol has been most commonly used in the United States for this treatment, although similar therapeutic  benefits  can  be  seen  with  many  other anabolic steroids.The maintenance dose is tailored to the individual, and is determined with close monitoring of both side effects and changes to blood coagulation parameters. Esterified injectables and oral non-alkylated steroids do not produce the same fibrinolytic response.<span class="s33">70</span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark34">Infertility (Male)</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark35">In a small percentage of cases, anabolic/androgenic steroids may be prescribed for the treatment of male infertility. When the cause of infertility is low sperm concentration due to Leydig-cell secretion deficiencies, an androgen might be able to alleviate the condition. In such cases the steroid may increase the sperm count, sperm quality and the fructose concentration,</a><span class="s33">71 72 </span>which can increase the chance of conception. The oral androgen mesterolone (Proviron) is most commonly prescribed for this  purpose,  although  has  not  been  granted  FDA approval  for  sale  in  the  United  States.  Note  that anabolic/androgenic steroids usually reduce male fertility, so the potential for these agents to successfully treat male fertility is limited.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Growth Failure</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic steroids may be prescribed to treat growth failure  in  children,  both  with  and  without  growth hormone deficiency. These agents have been shown to have positive effects on both muscle and bone mass. When they are administered before the ends of the long bones (epiphysis) have fused and further linear growth has been halted, their anabolic effects on bone may support an increase in height<span class="s33">73  </span>This can occur both through direct anabolic action of the steroid on bone cells,  and  indirectly  via  the  stimulation  of  growth hormone and IGF-1 release.<span class="s33">74 </span>An anabolic steroid that is non-aromatizable and non-estrogenic is typically used for this  purpose,  as  estrogen  is  known  to  cause  an acceleration of growth arrest. Anabolic steroid therapy must always be used with caution in pediatric patients, however. In addition to the possibility of common adverse effects, even non-aromatizable steroids may accelerate the rate of epiphysis closure.<span class="s33">75</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In the United States, oxandrolone is the anabolic steroid most widely prescribed for the treatment of growth failure. It is usually given as a supportive medication, used to  augment  the  anabolic  effects  of  human  growth hormone therapy.The drug is typically taken for periods of 6-12 months at a time, in an effort to accelerate the growth rate without substantially affecting the rate of epiphysis fusion. A dosage of 2.5 mg per day is often used for this purpose, although this may be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the patient&#39;s sex, age, bodyweight, and sensitivity to adverse effects. When used under  optimal  conditions,  the  result  may  be  an enhancement of the growth rate and an increase in total height compared to not initiating therapy.This benefit has been difficult to achieve consistently in clinical studies, however.

Benefits of therapy include the stimulation of new bone formation, inhibition  of  bone  resorption  (breakdown),  and enhancement of calcium absorption.<span class="s33">77 78  </span>These drugs have additionally been shown to reduce bone pain associated with osteoporosis<span class="s33">79</span>, a frequent complication with  elderly  patients  suffering  from  the  condition. Osteoporosis  is  most  common  in  postmenopausal women, and is usually linked to the changes in hormonal chemistry that are noted later in life. This disorder does occur to a high degree in the elderly of both sexes, however. Osteoporosis  can also be  caused by the prolonged administration of corticosteroids, which can directly stimulate bone resorption and inhibit new bone growth. This is identified as steroid- or glucocorticoid- induced osteoporosis.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone  decanoate  is  the  anabolic  steroid  most commonly prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis.

Male patients are given a nandrolone decanoate dosage of 50 mg once every 1 to 2 weeks. Therapy for both sexes is usually conducted for at least six months, and may last for one year or longer if necessary.The long therapeutic window is usually required in order to give the drug enough time to measurably effect bone strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In the United States, however, the use of an anabolic steroid such as nandrolone decanoate for the direct treatment  of  osteoporosis  is  presently  viewed  as controversial. In spite of substantial clinical data and history supporting the use of steroids for this purpose in the United States, many medical organizations hold the opinion that the potential side effects of steroid therapy are  too  substantial  to  justify  their  benefits  with osteoporosis. No agent is presently FDA approved for this purpose. Oxandrolone does remain FDA approved for osteoporosis patients, but for the specific purpose of alleviating bone pain associated with the disease, not for augmenting  bone  mineral  density.  Anabolic  steroids remain in use for osteoporosis in many other nations, however, and are still prescribed to varying patient populations including men, women, and the elderly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark38">Turner&#39;s and Klinefelter&#39;s Syndrome</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may be used to treat certain genetic conditions, most commonly Turner&#39;s syndrome in females and Klinefelter&#39;s syndrome in males. Both are chromosomal disorders characterized by deviations from the normal XX/XY pairing. They result in (among other health  issues)  abnormalities  in  growth,  sexual development, and ongoing sexual functioning. Males with Klinefelter&#39;s syndrome are sterile, and typically have a rounder (less muscular) physique.They also develop small testicles  (microorchidism),  and  may  suffer  with gynecomastia. In these patients the supplementation of testosterone  (in  a  similar  fashion  to  that  used  for androgen replacement therapy) is common, and can help alleviate some of the issues with sexual functioning and body composition. Females with Turner&#39;s syndrome will be  of  short  stature,  and  develop  other  physical abnormalities including a broad chest, low hairline, low- set ears, and webbed neck. Low doses of a primarily anabolic steroid may be used in adolescent patients as an adjunct to growth hormone therapy to support the linear growth rate. Oxandrolone is the steroid most commonly used in the United States for this purpose, and has been clinically successful at increasing final height when used in dosage of .05-.1 mg/kg per day.<span class="s33">84</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39">Weight Loss/Muscle Wasting</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic steroids may be administered for the treatment of clinically significant weight loss. Common causes include  prolonged  corticosteroid  therapy,  extensive surgery, chronic infections or severe trauma. In a general sense, these agents can be highly useful when a patient is subject to a long hospital stay or period of bed rest, when normal daily muscle stimulation is not present and a significant loss of muscle mass is noticed. Severe burn</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">injuries may also call for the supportive application of anabolic steroids, as this is a type of injury also associated with  secondary  muscle  loss.  Anabolic  steroids  may additionally be prescribed to individuals with weight loss not associated with any known cause. The failure to maintain a healthy (normal) level of body weight for ones&#39; height, and an inability of diet and exercise alone to correct weight loss, are usually the determining factors in recommending such treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The significant loss of lean body mass can present its own set of health issues. Individuals that are chronically underweight may suffer from low energy and a reduced sense of wellness, and are at greater risk of mortality.<span class="s33">85 </span>Severe weight loss during recovery from surgery or illness may also measurably delay or complicate the recovery phase.<span class="s33">86 </span>In the most severe cases, an ability of the patient to maintain acceptable lean body mass can be the key determining factor in recovery. The ability of anabolic steroids to increase protein synthesis makes them among the most accepted agents for the treatment of clinically significant weight loss, provided the patient does not have a health condition or is taking any other medicine that would exclude them from using these drugs. They can positively affect both muscle and bone as well, making them very versatile anabolic agents.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In the United States, oxandrolone is the agent most frequently  prescribed  for  most  kinds  of  clinically significant weight loss.The dosage used for this purpose is typically 10 mg given twice per day (20 mg total), although lower doses may be given in some female, elderly,  or  younger  patients  in  an  effort  to  avoid undesirable  androgenic  side  effects.  The  drug  is commonly administered for a period of 3 to 4 weeks during the early stages of recovery, although may be given for a longer duration if necessary. Given that the support of constructive protein metabolism is a trait shared by virtually all anabolic steroids, many agents other then oxandrolone are clinically useful for this purpose. In many other regions, agents with a high anaboiic-to-androgenic  activity  ratio  are  predominantly</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">used for this purpose including stanozolol, nandrolone, methenolone, and methandrostenolone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic steroids may also be prescribed to treat more severe cases of muscle wasting. This is a condition characterized  by  strong  ongoing  protein  catabolism, which means that muscle protein is being predominantly broken down (as opposed to synthesized) in the body, and a progressive loss of weight, strength, and energy is noticed. In a medical setting, severe muscle wasting is referred to as cachexia. Cachexia is not associated with insufficient food intake (dietary malnutrition), but has a metabolic cause than cannot be alleviated with changes in  diet.  This  cause  is  also  usually  identified  when discussing the condition (ie, cancer cachexia, HIV related cachexia).  HIV  related  muscle  wasting  is  the  most common form of cachexia treated with anabolic steroids. The use of these drugs as supportive therapy for cancer cachexia has not been well established, however, and currently the subject of ongoing investigation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone decanoate, oxandrolone, and oxymethoIone have been the anabolic steroids most commonly used in the U.S. to treat muscle wasting specifically associated with  HIV  infection.  Although  no  specific  FDA recommendations  have  been  adopted,  studies  with nandrolone decanoate have shown a dosage of 150 mg every 14 days to have a similar anabolic benefit, and a significantly lower incidence of side effects, as 6 mg (18IU) of  human  growth  hormone  per  day.<span class="s33">87  </span>In  2003, oxymethoIone was the subject of successful Phase III clinical trials for HIV wasting.<span class="s33">88 </span>The dosage of this study (100-150 mg per day) mirrors those that are most commonly prescribed by physicians. In recent years, however, the discontinuance of nandrolone decanoate on the  pharmaceutical  market  and  a  perceived  higher patient  comfort  profile  in  oxandrolone  has  made oxandrolone the preferred agent for HIV cachexia. The dosage of oxandrolone used may range from 20 mg to 80 mg per day. The most consistent clinical benefits have been seen with a 40 mg and 80 mg daily dose.<span class="s33">89</span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Steroid Side Effects</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While anabolic/androgenic steroids (AAS) are generally regarded as therapeutic drugs with high safety, their use can also be associated with a number of adverse cosmetic, physical, and psychological effects. Many of these side effects  are  often  apparent  during  therapeutic-use conditions, although their incidence tends to increase profoundly as the dosages reach supratherapeutic ranges. Virtually  everyone  that  abuses  anabolic/androgenic steroids  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes notices some form of adverse effects from their use. According to one study, the exact frequency of tangible side effects in a group of steroid abusers was 96.4%. This shows very clearly that it is far more rare to abuse these drugs and not notice side effects than it is to endure them.<span class="s33">90  </span>In addition  to the side effects  that anabolic/androgenic steroids can have on various internal systems, there are others which may not be immediately apparent to the user. The following is a summary of the biological systems and reactions effected by AAS use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark40">Cardiovascular System</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The   use   of   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   in supratherapeutic (and often therapeutic) doses can have a number of adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. This  may  be  noticed  in  several  areas  including unfavorable alterations in serum cholesterol, a thickening of  ventricular  walls,  increased  blood  pressure,  and changes in vascular reactivity. In an acute sense these drugs are admittedly very safe. The risk of an otherwise healthy person suffering a heart attack from an isolated steroid cycle is extremely remote.The risk of stroke is also extremely low. When these drugs are abused for long periods,  however,  their  adverse  effects  on  the cardiovascular system are given time to accumulate. An increased chance of early death due to heart attack or stroke is, likewise, a valid risk with long-term steroid abuse. In order to better understand this risk, we must look specifically at how anabolic/androgenic steroids affect the cardiovascular system in several key ways.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark41">Cholesterol/Lipids</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids use can adversely affect both HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol values. The ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol fractions provides a rough snapshot of the ongoing disposition of plaque in the arteries, either favoring atherogenic or anti-atherogenic actions. The general pattern seen during steroid use is a lowering of HDL concentrations, which is often combined</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">with stable or increased LDL levels.Triglyceride levels may also increase.The shift can be unfavorable in all directions. Note that in some cases, the total cholesterol count will not change significantly. The total cholesterol level can, therefore, give a false representation of uncompromised lipid health. Almost invariably the underlying HDL/LDL ratio will decrease. While this ratio should return to normal following the cessation of steroid intake, plaque deposits in the arteries are more permanent. If unfavorable shifts in lipids are exacerbated by the long-term use of steroidal compounds, significant damage to the cardiovascular system can result.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="260" height="175" alt="image" src="img/Image_024.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 91pt;text-indent: -58pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Over time, plaque deposits may begin to narrow and clog arteries.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids are most consistent in their lowering of HDL levels. This adverse effect is mediated through the androgenic stimulation of hepatic lipase, a liver enzyme responsible for the breakdown of HDL (good) cholesterol.<span class="s33">91 </span>With more hepatic lipase activity in the body, the favorable (anti-atherogenic) HDL cholesterol particles are cleared from circulation more quickly, and their levels drop. This is an effect that seems to be very pronounced at even modest supratherapeutic dosage levels. For example, studies with testosterone cypionate noted a 21% drop in HDL cholesterol with a dosage of 300 mg per week.<span class="s33">92 </span>Increasing this dosage to 600 mg did not have any significant additional effect, suggesting that the dosage threshold for strong HDL suppression is fairly low.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Oral steroids, especially c-17 alpha alkylated compounds, are particularly potent at stimulating hepatic lipase and suppressing  HDL levels. This is due to first pass concentration and metabolism in the liver. A drug like</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">stanozolol may, therefore, be milder than testosterone with regard to androgenic side effects, but not when it comes to cardiovascular strain. A study comparing the effects of a weekly injection of 200 mg testosterone enanthate to only a 6 mg daily oral dose of stanozolol demonstrates the strong difference between these two types of drugs very well.<span class="s50">93 </span>After only six weeks, 6 mg of stanozolol  was  shown  to  reduce  HDL  and  HDL-2 cholesterol  levels  by  an  average  of  33  and  71% respectively. HDL levels (mainly the HDL-3 subfraction) were reduced by only 9% in the testosterone group. LDL cholesterol levels also rose 29% with stanozolol, while they dropped 16% with testosterone. Esterified injectable steroids are generally less stressful to the cardiovascular system than oral agents.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is also important to note that estrogens can have a favorable  impact  on  cholesterol  profiles.  The aromatization of testosterone to estradiol may, therefore, prevent a more dramatic change in serum cholesterol. A study  examined  this  effect  by  comparing  the  lipid changes caused by 280 mg of testosterone enanthate per week,  with  and  without  the  aromatase  inhibitor testolactone.<span class="s50">94 </span>Methyltestosterone was also tested in a third group, at a dose of 20 mg daily, to judge the comparative effect of an oral alkylated steroid.The group using only testosterone enanthate in this study showed a small but not significant decrease in HDL cholesterol values over the course of the 12-week investigation. After only four weeks, however, the group using testosterone plus the aromatase inhibitor displayed an HDL reduction of  an  average  of  25%.  The  group  taking methyltestosterone  experienced  the  strongest  HDL reduction in the study, which dropped 35% after four weeks.This group also noticed an unfavorable rise in LDL cholesterol levels.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The potential positive effect of estrogen on cholesterol values also makes the issue of estrogen maintenance something to consider when it comes to health risks. To begin with, one may want to consider whether or not estrogen maintenance drugs are actually necessary in any given circumstance. Are side effects apparent, or is their use a preventative step and perhaps unnecessary? The maintenance drug of choice can also have a measurable impact  on  cholesterol  outcomes.  For  example,  the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen citrate does not seem to exhibit anti-estrogenic effects on cholesterol values, and in fact tends to increase HDL levels in some patients. Many individuals decide to use tamoxifen to combat estrogenic side effects instead of an aromatase inhibitor for this reason, particularly when they are using steroids for longer periods of time, and are concerned about their cumulative cardiovascular side effects.</p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark42">Enlarged Heart</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The human heart is a muscle.

One potential adverse effect <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>this is polycythemia, or the overproduction of red blood cells. Polycythemia can be reflected in the hematocrit level, or the percentage of blood volume that is made up of red cells. As the hematocrit rises, so too does the viscosity of the blood. If the blood becomes too thick, its ability to circulate becomes impaired. This can greatly increase the risk of serious thrombic event including embolism and stroke. A high hematocrit level is also an independent risk factor for heart disease.<span class="s33">129 </span>The normal hematocrit level in men is 40.7 to 50.3%, and in women it is 36.1 to 44.3% (numbers may vary very slightly depending on the source). For the sake of scale, while a hematocrit of 50% may be normal, a hematocrit of 60% or above is considered critical (life threatening).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/steroid  administration  tends  to  raise  the hematocrit level by several percentage points, sometimes more. As a result, many steroid-using bodybuilders will have hematocrit levels that are above the normal range. For example, one study measured the average hematocrit in a group of steroid abusing competitive bodybuilders to be 55.7%.<span class="s33">130 </span>This level is considered clinically high, and would increase blood viscosity enough to raise the risk of serious cardiovascular event. Although not likely to be an isolated cause, high hematocrit is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of a number of steroid abusers,  usually  paired  with  high  blood  pressure, homocysteine,  and/or  atherosclerosis.  The  average hematocrit   level   in   bodybuilders   not   taking anabolic/androgenic steroids was 45.6%, well within the normal range for healthy adult men.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Many physicians that specialize in hormone replacement therapy consider a hematocrit level of 55% to be an absolute  cutoff  point.  At  or  above  this  point,  and anabolic/androgenic  steroid  therapy  cannot  be continued safely. Drug intake would be ceased at this</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">point until the hematocrit issues have been corrected. Minor elevations in hematocrit may be addressed with phlebotomy. For this, <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">1 </span>pint of blood may be removed periodically  during  steroid  intake,  often  every  two months.  Proper  hydration  is  also  important,  as dehydration can temporarily cause the hematocrit level <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>elevate, giving a false positive for polycythemia.The daily intake  of  aspirin  is  also  commonly  advised  if  the hematocrit is above normal, as this will reduce platelet aggregation,  or  the  tendency  for  platelets  to  stick together and form clots.

These cells are found on the inside of all blood vessels, and help increase or decrease blood flow and pressure by relaxing or constricting the vessels (referred  to  as  vasodilation  and  vasoconstriction, respectively).These cells also help regulate the passage of materials in and out of blood vessels, and are involved in a number of important vascular processes including blood clotting and new blood vessel formation. Having a more flexible (reactive) endothelium is generally considered desirable for health, and, likewise, the endothelium is often  compromised  in  individuals  with  cardiovascular disease. Patients with endothelial dysfunction tend to notice  greater  vasoconstriction,  restricted  blood  flow, higher blood pressure, local inflammation, and reduced circulatory capacity.<span class="s33">142 </span>This may placethem at greater risk for heart attack, stroke, or thrombosis (blood clot).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Endothelial cells are androgen responsive, which may partly account for men exhibiting less vascular reactivity than  women.<span class="s33">143  </span>Similarly,  anabolic/androgenic  steroid use has been shown to impair endothelial activity and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">vascular reactivity.

This  results  in  functional  differences  in immunity between the sexes.Women tend to have a more active immune system compared to men, and are slightly more resistant to bacterial infection and other types of infection.<span class="s33">146 </span>The female immune system is also more prone to developing autoimmune diseases, which may be linked to its higher level of activity.<span class="s33">147 </span>The day-to-day activity  of  the  immune  system  can  also  fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, further demonstrating the strong influence of sex steroids.<span class="s33">148 </span>The slightly weaker resistance to infection of men appears to be caused by testosterone,   which   is   an   immunosuppressive hormone.<span class="s33">149  </span>Androgens  may  modulate  the  immune system directly, through their conversion to estrogens,<span class="s33">150 </span>or by modifying glucocorticoid activity.<span class="s33">151</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  have  displayed  both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive actions in animal models.<span class="s33">152 </span>Given that these drugs can influence the immune system through a variety of pathways, and anabolic steroids are a fairly diverse class of drugs, their effects on the immune system may vary depending on the  particular  conditions.  When  used  therapeutically, changes in immune system functioning are usually minor, and have not amounted to strong immunostimulation or immunosuppression. Anabolic/androgenic steroids have also been used safely in many immunocompromised patients, such as those with muscle wasting associated with HIV infection, without any significant change in immune system or viral markers.<span class="s33">153154</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The   use   of   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   in supratherapeutic  doses  may  slightly  impair  immune system functioning, reducing an individual&#39;s resistance to certain types of infection. In one study, steroid abusers were shown to have lower serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA  immunoglobulins  (antibodies)  compared  to bodybuilding    controls,    consistent    with immunosuppression.<span class="s33">155  </span>Although  this  may  logically increase the chance of contracting certain types of illness,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark51">a significant increase in the history of illness could not </a><span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>established in these same steroid abusers.

In fact, there are many instances in which these drugs may be used as supportive  treatment  in  patients  with  compromised kidney function. For example, anabolic steroids have been prescribed to increase the production of red blood cells in patients with anemia related to various forms of kidney disease.<span class="s33">156 157 </span>They have even been used as general anabolic  (lean  body  mass)  support,  and  to  treat hypogonadism,  in  patients  undergoing  dialysis.<span class="s33">158  159 </span>While care must be taken with such patients, therapy may often be conducted very safely. In otherwise healthy individuals,clinical renal toxicity caused by the short-term administration of anabolic/androgenic steroids is unlikely.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">There  have  been  isolated  reports  of severe kidney damage in steroid abusers.

Its appearance in adult steroid users is suspect, but not conclusive evidence that drugs were the actual cause.There have also been isolated reports of renal cell carcinoma in steroid abusers.<span class="s33">162 163 </span>Since this is the most common form of kidney cancer, however, conclusive links are again difficult to draw.There have additionally been case reports of combined liver and renal failure with steroid abuse.<span class="s33">164 165 </span>In these cases kidney failure may have been subsequent to steroid- induced liver toxicity, as cholestasis (bile duct obstruction) is known to cause acute tubular necrosis and renal failure.<span class="s33">166</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Kidney health should be a concern for long-term steroid- using bodybuilders and power athletes.

A condition called rhabdomyolysis is caused by the extreme damage of muscle tissue, which releases  myoglobin  and  a  number  of  nephrotoxic compounds into the blood.<span class="s33">167  </span>In high levels this can damage kidney tissue and even cause renal failure.

These compounds can cause serious and sometimes life­ threatening damage when abused, and occasionally even under therapeutic conditions. Those agents commonly associated with clinical hepatotoxicity include (but are not  limited  to)  fluoxymesterone,  methandrostenolone, methylandrostenediol,        methyltestosterone, norethandrolone,  oxymethoIone,  and  stanozolol.<span class="s33">173  174 </span><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">17517617? </span>These steroids all have either an ethyl or methyl group at carbon-17 (c-17alpha alkylation). All c-17alpha alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  possess  some level of hepatotoxicity. Liver strain,as assessed by elevated liver enzymes, has also been reported with non-alkylated esterified  injectable  steroids  including  nandrolone decanoate and testosterone enanthate in extremely rare instances.<span class="s33">178  </span><span class="s50">179  </span>These  steroids  have  never  been associated with serious hepatic damage, however, and are not regarded as liver toxic.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Alkylation of c-17alpha specifically protects the steroid molecule  from  metabolism  by  <span style=" color: #393939;">the  </span>enzyme  17beta- hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  (17beta-HSD).  This enzyme normally oxidizes a steroid&#39;s 17beta-hydroxyl (17beta-ol) group, which must remain intact for the drug to impart any anabolic or androgenic effect. Oxidation of 17-beta-ol is one of the primary pathways of hepatic steroid  deactivation.  Without  protection  from  this enzyme, very little active drug will survive the first pass through the liver and reach circulation after oral dosing. Alkylation of c-17alpha effectively protects the steroid from  17beta-HSD  by  occupying  a  hydrogen  bond necessary for the breakdown of 17beta-ol to 17-keto.The compound must be metabolized through other pathways as  a  result,  and  immediate  hepatic  deactivation  is prevented. The process allows a very high percentage of the steroid dose to pass into the bloodstream intact, but it also places some strain on the liver in the process.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">The exact mechanism  of hepatotoxicity  induced by alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   remains</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">unknown, but it is speculated to be due in large part to the natural activity of androgens in the liver. This liver possesses a high concentration of androgen receptors, and  is  responsive  to  these  hormones.<span class="s33">180  </span>With physiological  androgens  such  as  testosterone  and dihydrotestosterone, however, only a moderate level of activity is permitted in this organ.This is because the liver is normally very efficient at metabolizing steroids, which mutes their local activity. But with the liver unable to easily deactivate alkylated steroids, however, a far greater level of hepatic androgenic activity is allowed. The concentration of steroid in the liver is also very high after oral administration, as the digestive tract delivers the drug directly to this organ before it can reach circulation. The fact that the most potent steroid ever given to humans on a mg-for-mg basis is also the most liver toxic, also supports  a  close  association  between  androgenic potency and hepatotoxicity.<span class="s33">181182</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Early liver toxicity is usually visible in blood test results for hepatic  function  before  physical  symptoms  or dysfunction  develop.  This  is  most  likely  to  include elevations in aminotransferase enzymes AST and ALT, also called serum glutamic-oxalocetic transaminase (SGOT) and  serum  glutamic  pyruvic  transaminase  (SGPT), respectively.  The  cholestatic  enzymes  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) may also be elevated, along with other markers (see:  Understanding  Blood  Tests).  Screening  for abnormalities in hepatic markers is regarded as the most effective way of preventing liver damage from steroid administration.  Should  asymptomatic  toxicity  go unnoticed and without a change in drug intake, it is likely to progress to more severe hepatic strain, injury, or hepatic dysfunction. Immediate cessation of anabolic/androgenic steroid use and a full assessment of liver and full-body health is advised should any signs of unacceptable liver toxicity become apparent.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The most common form of actual liver dysfunction caused by  the  administration  of  oral  anabolic/androgenic steroids is cholestasis.<span class="s33">183</span>This describes a condition where the flow of bile becomes decreased, usually because of obstruction  of  the  small  bile  ducts  in  the  liver (intrahepatic). This causes bile salts and bilirubin to accumulate in the liver and blood instead of being properly  excreted  thorough  the  digestive  tract. Inflammation  (hepatitis)  may  also  be  present.<span class="s33">184 </span>Symptoms of cholestasis may include anorexia, malaise, nausea,  vomiting,  upper  abdominal  pain, or pruritus (itching). The stool may also change to a clay color (alcholic stool) due to the reduced excretion of bile, and the urine may become amber. Cholestatic jaundice may develop, which is characterized by a yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes due to high levels of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). Intrahepatic cholestasis may also coincide with hepatocellular necrotic lesions (death of liver tissue).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Intrahepatic cholestasis will usually resolve itself without serious  injury  or  medical  intervention  within  several weeks of discontinuing all hepatotoxic steroids. More serious cases may take several months before normal hepatic enzyme levels and functioning are restored. Hepatic lesions are likely to heal over time as well, at least partially.  In  some  cases  physicians  have  initiated supportive  treatment  with  ursodeoxycholic  acid (ursodiol), which is a secondary bile salt known to possess hepatoprotective and anti-cholestatic effects, in an effort to hasten recovery.<span class="s33">185  </span>The exact value of using this medication to treat steroid-induced cholestatic jaundice remains unknown, however. The liver is highly resilient, and  intrahepatic  cholestasis  is  unlikely  to  continue degrading after drug discontinuance unless additional pathologies are present.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark53">More serious hepatic complications are rare, but have included peliosis hepatis</a><span class="s33">186  </span>(blood-filled cysts on the liver),  portal  hypertension  with  variceal  bleeding<span class="s33">187 </span>(bleeding caused by increased blood pressure in portal vein related to obstructed blood flow), hepatocellular adenoma<span class="s33">188  </span>(non-malignant liver tumor), hepatocellular carcinoma<span class="s33">189</span>(malignant  liver  tumor),  and  hepatic angiosarcoma<span class="s33">190  </span>(aggressive malignant cancer of the lining of blood vessels inside the liver). Some of these pathologies can be very insidious at times, developing quickly and without clear early symptoms. Although many of these potentially life-threatening side effects have often been attributed to very ill patients receiving steroid medications, a growing number of case reports are now involving otherwise healthy young bodybuilders abusing these drugs.

Excess stimulation, as with steroid abuse, may also cause a significant increase in the size of the sebaceous glands.<span class="s33">193 </span>Sebaceous glands are found at the base of the hair follicles in all hair-containing areas of the skin. If the androgen level becomes too high and the sebaceous glands become overactive, the hair follicles may begin to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">clog with sebum and dead skin cells, resulting in acne. Acne vulgaris (common acne) is frequent in steroid users, especially when the drugs are taken in supratherapeutic levels. This often includes acne lesions on the face, back, shoulders, and/or chest.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A mild incidence of acne vulgaris is usually addressed with topical over-the-counter acne medications and a rigorous skin cleaning routine that removes excess oil and dirt. More serious acne may develop in sensitive individuals, including acne conglobata (severe acne with connected nodules  under  the  skin)  or  acne  fulminans  (highly destructive inflammatory acne). Such incidences may require  medical  intervention,  which  usually  involves treatment with isotretinoin. Topical anti-androgen drugs are also under investigation for the treatment of severe acne, and have shown a great deal of promise in early trials.<span class="s33">194 </span>Acne is typically resolved with the cessation of steroid use, although the overproduction of sebum may persist until the sebaceous glands have had time to atrophy back to original size.

This disorder is characterized by a progressive miniaturization of hair follicles, and a shortening of the anagen phase of hair growth, under androgen influence. The hair produced by affected follicles will progressively thin, covering the scalp less and less effectively. In men, the baldness produced is usually identified most simply as male pattern.This will initially include a receding hairline (fronto-temporal thinning) and thinning on the crown, areas where androgen receptor concentrations are high.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In women, the balding usually takes on a more diffuse pattern, with thinning throughout the top of the head.

It is especially common in males, and more than 50% of the population will notice it by the age of 50.<span class="s50">195 </span>As its name signifies, androgenetic alopecia  involves  the  interplay  of  both  androgenic hormones  and  genetic  factors.  Individuals  with  this condition  appear  to  be  more  locally  sensitive  to androgens, and have higher levels of androgen receptor protein  and  dihydrotestosterone  in  the  scalp,  in comparison   to   those   unaffected.<span class="s33">196   </span>Although dihydrotestosterone is identified as the primary hormone involved in the progress of androgenetic alopecia, it does not possess a unique ability to influence this condition. All anabolic/androgenic steroids stimulate the same cellular receptor, and as a result are capable of providing the necessary androgenic stimulation. Baldness can result from steroid use, even in the absence of steroids that convert to, or are derived from, dihydrotestosterone.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The genetics of androgenetic alopecia are not fully understood. At one time it was believed this condition could be inherited solely from the maternal grandfather. More recent evidence contradicts this notion, however, showing strong support for father-to-son transmission in many cases.<span class="s33">197 </span>A number of genes have been identified as having a potential link to the disorder, including certain variants  (polymorphisms)  of  the  androgen  receptor gene.<span class="s33">198 </span><span class="s50">199 </span>No single genetic variant alone has yet been able  to  explain  all  cases  of  androgenetic  alopecia, however. AGA is now believed to involve several genes</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">(polygenic).<span class="s33">200 </span>The way these genes combine, and the level of androgens in the scalp, may ultimately work together  to  control  the  onset  and  severity  of androgenetic  alopecia.  Estrogen  is  also  known  to lengthen the anagen phase,<span class="s33">201 </span>and the pathogenesis of this condition may ultimately involve genes that alter both androgen and estrogen activity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Treatment  for  androgenetic  alopecia  in  men  usually involves topical minoxidil and oral finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase  enzyme  inhibitor.  Women  are  typically prescribed anti-androgens and estrogen/progestin drugs. The focus in both cases is on reducing relative androgenic action in the scalp, which may (at least temporarily) stall the condition. With this in mind, many steroid users concerned with hair loss will tailor their drug intake to minimize unnecessary androgenic activity. This usually involves moderate dosing and the careful selection of drugs with high anabolic-to-androgenic ratios, such as oxandrolone, methenolone, or nandrolone. Alternatively, some may choose to use injectable testosterone esters combined  with  finasteride  to  reduce  scalp  DHT conversion.These strategies are met with varying degrees of success.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark56">There has been no study on the role of genetics in baldness linked to steroid abuse. Anecdotally, individuals with existing visible androgenetic alopecia appear to be those   most   susceptible   to   the   effects   of anabolic/androgenic steroids on the scalp. For many of these  people,  the  loss  of  hair  appears  significantly accelerated when taking these drugs. On the other hand, this side effect is generally a much less significant issue with  individuals  that  have  not  noticed  thinning beforehand. Many go on to abuse steroids for years without any visible effect at all, making it clear that there is more to this disorder than local androgen levels. It is well understood that androgens play a role in the progression  of  androgenetic  alopecia  for  those genetically prone.Steroid use can, therefore, coincide with the first noticeable onset of this condition. It is unknown, however, if anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse can cause baldness in an individual that does not carry any genetic susceptibility.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stunted Growth</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may inhibit linear growth when  administered  before  physical  maturity.  These hormones actually can have a dichotomous influence on linear height. On one hand, their anabolic effects may increase the retention of calcium in the bones, facilitating linear growth. A number of anabolic steroid programs have been successful in helping children with short stature achieve a faster rate of growth. At the same time,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">however, anabolic/androgenic steroid use may cause premature closure of the growth plates, which inhibits further linear growth, There have been a number of cases of noticeably stunted growth (short stature) in juvenile athletes that have taken these drugs.<span class="s33">202 </span>The specific outcome of steroid therapy depends on the type and dose of drug administered, the age in which it is administered,  the  length  it  is  taken,  and  the responsiveness of the patient.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While  androgens,  estrogens,  and  glucocorticoids  all inherently  participate  in  bone  maturity,  estrogen  is regarded as the primary inhibitor of linear growth in both men and women.<span class="s33">203 </span>Women are shorter on average than men, and also tend to stop growing at a slightly earlier age,  due  to  the  effects  of  this  hormone. Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  that  either  convert  to estrogen or are inherently estrogenic are, likewise, more likely to inhibit linear growth than other agents. Popular anabolic/androgenic  steroids  with  estrogenic  activity include (but are not limited to) boldenone, testosterone, methyltestosterone,  methandrostenolone,  nandrolone, and oxymethoIone. These drugs must be used with additional caution in young patients due to their stronger potential for inducing growth arrest.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Estrogen acts directly on the epiphyseal growth plates to inhibit linear growth. These plates are located at the end of growing bones, and contain a collection of stem-like cells called chondrocytes. These cells proliferate and differentiate to form new bone cells, slowly expanding the length of the bones and the height of the individual. These cells have a finite life span, with programmed senescence (cell death). This will cause the rate of chondrocyte  proliferation  to  slow  over  time,  and eventually stop. The chondrocytes are replaced with blood and bone cells at the point of physical maturity, &quot;fusing&quot; the bones and inhibiting further linear growth. The stimulation of estrogen appears to accelerate bone age  advancement  by  exhausting  the  proliferative potential of chondrocytes at an earlier time.<span class="s33">204</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Age will also influence a patient&#39;s sensitivity to epiphyseal fusion. As young children are far from the point of bone maturity, the inhibitive effects of hormone therapy take longer to manifest in growth cessation. As the juvenile ages, they may become more sensitive to these effects. Studies treating teenage boys (average age 14 years) for tall  stature,  for  example,  found  that  six  months of testosterone enanthate (500 mg every two weeks) was sufficient to reduce final height by almost three inches compared  to  the  predicted  outcome.<span class="s33">205  </span>This  is  a moderately supratherapeutic dose, underlining the fact that steroid intake during adolescence can have a very tangible impact on height.This issue may not be as simple</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">as avoiding estrogenic steroids either, as non-estrogenic steroids  have  also  induced  skeletal  maturation.<span class="s33">206 </span>Individuals remain warned of the potential for growth interruption when anabolic/androgenic steroids are used before physical maturity.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark57">Tendon Injury</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroid use is sometimes associated with an increased incidence of tendon injury.<span class="s33">207208 </span>There are a few potential causes for this. One of the most basic is the rapid growth of the muscles. Under the influence of anabolic/androgenic steroids, the muscles are capable of becoming significantly larger and stronger in a fairly short period of time. As the amount of weight lifted by the steroid user increases, so too does the load placed on the tendons. If the tendons are not given enough time to (or simply cannot) compensate for the added strain, they may rupture during training or athletic performance. Thus, anabolic steroids may indirectly lead to this type of injury in some users, essentially by making them too strong for their own connective tissues.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">There may also be more direct mechanisms contributing to this type of injury. Similar to skeletal muscle tissue, the tendons are responsive to androgens. Studies show that under the stimulation of anabolic steroids, the tendons become more rigid <span class="s33">209 </span>As tissue flexibility is reduced, so is the relative strength and forgiving nature of the tendons (essentially  lowering  the  tearing  point).  Furthermore, while anabolic steroids are known to aid the healing process in the muscles, studies suggest that they may actually impair the healing of tendon injuries.<span class="s33">210 </span>While this is admittedly a post-injury event, one could speculate that smaller areas of damage might not repair properly, weakening the tissues.These factors,coupled with a rising workload  due  to  expanded  strength  capacity,  could explain  a  greater  potential  for  tendon  injury  during anabolic/androgenic steroid use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  data  concerning  the  potential  role  of  anabolic steroids in connective tissue injury is equivocal. Some studies find no association between AAS use and tendon injury.<span class="s33">211 </span>Overall, these types of injuries are still fairly uncommon.This could make proving an association with anabolic steroid use difficult. The level of AAS use is also undoubtedly a strong contributing factor in this type of injury. When we do see tendon ruptures, they tend to be reported in more advanced bodybuilders and steroid abusers. On the other hand, tendon injury (without a specific  accident  event)  seems  to  be  extremely uncommon in those that use AAS moderately and keep their body mass within reasonable levels.The potential for this type of injury is one reason many believe it is better to accumulate mass slowly and steadily with AAS, instead of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">rushing to put on the most bulk possible.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark58">Water and Salt Retention</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may increase the amount of water and sodium stored in the body. This may include increases in both the intracellular and extracellular water compartments. Intracellular fluid refers to water that has been drawn inside the cells. While this does not increase the protein content of the muscles, it does expand the muscle cell, and is often calculated and viewed as a part of total fat free body mass. Extracellular water is stored in the circulatory system, as well as in various body tissues, in the spaces between cells (interstitial). Increases in interstitial fluid can be noticeable and troubling cosmetically. In strong cases this can bring about a very puffy appearance to the body (peripheral or localized edema), with bloating of the hands, arms, body, and face. This may reduce the visibility of muscle features throughout the physique. Excess fluid retention can also be associated with elevated blood pressure,<span class="s33">212 </span>which can increase cardiovascular and renal strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Estrogen is a regulator of fluid retention in both men and women.<span class="s33">213 </span>This effect appears to be mediated in part by changes in hypothalamic arginine vasopressin (AVP), the primary  hormone  involved  in  controlling  water reabsorption  in  the  kidneys.<span class="s33">214  </span>Increased  levels  of estrogen tend to increase AVP levels, which can promote the increased storage of water. Estrogen also appears to act on the renal tubes in the kidneys in an aldosterone­ independent manner to increase the reabsorption of sodium.<span class="s33">215  </span>Sodium  is  the  major  electrolyte  in  the extracellular  environment,  and helps  to regulate the osmotic balance of cells. Higher levels can significantly increase  water  in  the  extracellular  compartment. Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  that  either  convert  to estrogen, or possess inherent estrogenic activity, are, likewise, those steroids that are associated with increased extracellular water retention.<span class="s33">216</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  are  generally favored for mass gaining (bulking) purposes. A steroid user may ignore water retention during this phase of training, occasionally even finding the sheer increases in size to be a welcome benefit. Estrogenic steroids such as testosterone and oxymethoIone are also regarded as the strongest mass-and strength-building agents, which may be caused in part by anabolic benefits of elevated estrogenic activity.The excess water stored in the muscles, joints, and connective tissues is also commonly believed to increase an individual&#39;s resistance to injury. With the use of  many  strongly  estrogenic  anabolic/androgenic steroids, water retention can account for a large portion (35% or more) of the initial body weight gain during</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">steroid treatment. This weight is quickly lost once the steroids are discontinued or estrogenic activity is reduced.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Non-aromatizing  steroids  such  as  oxandrolone  and stanozolol have also been shown to promote increased water retention, so this effect is not entirely exclusive to aromatizable or estrogenic substances.<span class="s33">217 218  </span>Anabolic steroids with low or no estrogenic action tend to produce modest increases in whole body water and intracellular fluid  retention,  however,  and  not  in  the  visible extracellular  compartment.<span class="s33">219  220  </span>These  steroids  are considered to be more cosmetically appealing, and are generally favored by bodybuilders and athletes when looking to improve lean mass and muscle definition. Popular anabolic/androgenic steroids that are associated with low visible water retention include fluoxymesterone, methenolone, nandrolone, oxandrolone, stanozolol, and trenbolone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark59">Excess water retention may be addressed with the use of ancillary medications such as the anti-estrogen tamoxifen citrate, or an aromatase inhibitor such as anastrozole. By minimizing the activity of estrogens, these drugs can effectively reduce the level of stored water. In most cases where  an  aromatizable  steroid  is  used,  aromatase inhibitors prove to be significantly more effective at achieving  this  goal.  A  common  practice  among bodybuilders during competition is to also use a diuretic, which can shed excess water by directly increasing renal water excretion. This is regarded as the most effective method for rapidly improving muscle definition, but it can also be one of the most acutely risky practices as well. Water retention is not a persistent side effect of steroid use. Excess water is quickly eliminated, and normal water balance  returned,  once  anabolic/androgenic  steroid administration is halted.</a></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark60">Physical (Male)</a></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Dysphonia (Vocal Changes)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although far less common than dysphonia in women, anabolic/androgenic steroids may alter vocal physiology in men. This may include a deepening of the voice. Dysphonia is most common when anabolic/androgenic steroids are administered during adolescence, as the deeper adult voice has not yet been established under the influence  of  androgens.  The  administration  of anabolic/androgenic  steroids  before  maturity  can, likewise, cause a progressive lowering of the vocal pitch, and may trigger pubescent vocal changes in younger patients. Androgens have much less (often minimal) effect on vocal physiology in adulthood. Although a slight lowering of the voice may be noticed with androgen use in some cases, reports of clinically significant changes in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark61">the vocal quality of adult men are, likewise, very rare.There has also been an isolated report of stridor (vibrating noise when breathing) and vocal hoarseness in relation to anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse.</a><span class="s33">221 </span>This instance also involved smoking, however, making the direct influence of steroids more difficult  to discern. In general, vocal physiology is well established by adulthood. Aside from very  minor  reductions  in  pitch,  anabolic/androgenic steroids are not expected to have strong audible effects on the voice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gynecomastia</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids with significant estrogenic or  progestational  activity  may  cause  gynecomastia (female breast development in males). This disorder is specifically  characterized  by  the  growth  of  excess glandular tissue in men, due to an imbalance of male and female sex hormones in the breast. Estrogen is the primary supporter of mammary gland growth, and acts upon receptors in the breast to promote ductal epithelial hyperplasia, ductal elongation/branching, and fibroblast proliferation.<span class="s33">222  </span>Androgens, on the other hand, inhibit glandular tissue growth.<span class="s33">223 </span>High serum androgen levels and low estrogen usually prevent this tissue development in men, but it is possible in both sexes given the right hormonal environment. Gynecomastia is regarded as an unsightly side effect of anabolic/androgenic abuse by most users. In extreme cases the breast may take on a very female looking appearance, which is difficult to hide even with loose clothing.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Gynecomastia tends to develop in a series of progressive stages. The severity of this process will vary depending on the type and dose of drug(s) used, and individual sensitivity to hormones. The first sign is typically pain in the nipple area (gynecodynea).This may quickly coincide with minor swelling around the nipple area (lipomastia). This is sometimes referred to as pseudo-gynecomastia, as it primarily involves fat and not glandular tissue. At this stage, it may be possible to address mild nipple swelling by  reducing  or  eliminating  the  offending  steroidal compounds,  and  administering  an  appropriate  anti­ estrogenic medication for several weeks. If left untreated, however, this may quickly progress to clear gynecomastia, which involves significant fat,fibrous, and glandular tissue growth. The hard tissue growth may be easily felt in the early stages when pinching deeply around the nipple. Noticeable gynecomastia is likely to require corrective cosmetic surgery (male breast reduction).<span class="s33">224</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although gynecomastia is a very common side effect of steroid abuse, given its clear association with certain drugs or practices.it is also an easily avoidable one. Careful steroid selection and reasonable dosing are usually</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">regarded as the most basic and reliable methods for preventing its onset. Many steroid users also frequently take some form of estrogen maintenance medication, which may effectively counter the effects of elevated estrogenicity. Common options include the anti-estrogen tamoxifen citrate, or an aromatase inhibitor such as anastrozole. The use of a post-cycle hormone recovery program  at  the  conclusion  of  steroid  administration (which usually includes several weeks of anti-estrogen use) is also commonly advised, as gynecomastia is sometimes  reported  in  the  post-cycle  hormone imbalance phase when steroids are not actually being taken.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">It is important  to note  that progesterone can also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogen on mammary tissue growth.<span class="s33">225 </span>As such, progestational drugs may be able to trigger the onset of gynecomastia in sensitive individuals, even without elevating levels of estrogen. Many anabolic steroids, particularly those derived from nandrolone, are known to exhibit strong progestational activity. While gynecomastia is not a common compliant with these drugs, they are occasionally linked to this side effect in anecdotal reports. The anti-estrogen tamoxifen citrate is usually taken in such instances,as it can offset the effects of estrogen at the receptor, which are still necessary  for  progestins  to  impart  their  growth­ promoting effects on the breast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="324" height="287" alt="image" src="img/Image_028.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Early gynecomastia.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark62">Physical (Female)</a><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Birth Defects</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroid exposure to a woman during pregnancy can cause developmental abnormalities in an unborn fetus.

Early changes may include a light hoarsening of the voice, with audible shifts in pitch at the high and low end of the vocal spectrum (quiet speaking and voice projection).<span class="s33">226 </span>There is typically <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>lower general frequency during speech, a reduction of high frequency pitch, and voice instability and cracking.

Even as an adult, the female reproductive system remains developmentally responsive to male sex hormones. An elevation of the androgen level in women may  stimulate  the  growth  of  <span style=" color: #393939;">the  </span>clitoris  (clitoral hypertrophy).

As a virilizing side effect, clitoromegaly tends to occur in a dose-dependant  (androgenicity-dependent)  manner.  As such, higher doses and more androgenic substances (such as testosterone, trenbolone, and methandrostenolone) are more likely to trigger its onset. Primarily anabolic steroids such nandrolone, stanozolol, and oxandrolone are less androgenic and virilizing, and favored for the treatment of women for this reason. Clitoromegaly caused by  steroid  use  is  both  avoidable  and  progressive. Mitigating excess androgenic action early when it is noticed  is  the  most  fundamental  part  of  treatment.

Medically defined as hirsutism, this condition is characterized by the growth of hair in androgen sensitive areas of the body. With hirsutism, dark coarse hair (terminal hair) may develop on the face, chest, abdomen,  and  back,  areas  of  the  body  normally associated  with  hair  growth  in  men,  not  women. Treatment  for  hirsutism  typically  involves  immediate abstinence from anabolic/androgenic steroid intake, and initiation of a strategy to minimize androgen action at the hair follicles. This may include the use of oral estrogens, anti-androgens (spironolactone), or finasteride. Topical ketoconazole, an antifungal agent, has also been used with some success. The response to medical treatments may  be  slow,  and  the  changes  caused  by anabolic/androgenic steroid use may persist for a year or longer.<span class="s33">235 </span>Regular hair removal of the affected areas may be necessary. The severity of hirsutism will be related to the androgenicity of the drug(s) taken, the dosage and duration of use, and sensitivity of the individual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark67">Menstrual Irregularities</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark68">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may alter the menstrual cycle in females, resulting in infrequent or absent menses (amenorrhea).

What is known for certain is that sex steroids influence human psychology. They play a role in an individual&#39;s general mood, alertness, aggression, sense of well-being, and many other facets of our psychological state.There are known psychological differences between men and women because of differences in sex steroid levels, and, likewise, altering hormone levels with the administration  of  exogenous  steroids  may  influence human psychology. The exact strength of this association, however, remains the subject of much research and speculation. In reviewing some of the more substantial data that has been presented thus far, we find a better (though incomplete) understanding of the effects of AAS in several key areas of psychological health.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark70">Aggression</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Men  tend  to  be  more  aggressive  than  women,  a characteristic that has been partly attributed to higher androgen levels.<span class="s33">237 </span>Physiologically, androgens are known to act on the amygdala and hypothalamus, areas of the brain involved in human aggression.

Many  athletes  in explosive strength sports even specifically favor highly androgenic   drugs   such   as   testosterone, methyltestosterone, and fluoxymesterone due to their perceived greater abilities to support aggression and the competitive drive.<span class="s33">239  </span>While some association between steroid use and aggression is understood, the magnitude of this association remains the subject of much debate.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  psychological  effects  of  escalating  dosages  of testosterone esters have been examined in a number of placebo-controlled  studies.

Extensive psychological evaluations were taken using System Check List-90 (SCL-90) and the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ). Those using placebo steroids did not notice any significant psychological changes. Steroid abuse, however, was associated with higher levels of hostility in all HDHQ measures, with particular increases in acting out, criticism of others, paranoid hostility, guilt, self­ criticism, blaming of others, blaming of self, and overall hostility. SCL-90 ratings were also high during steroid abuse  for  obsessive  compulsiveness,  interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation. Hostility measures tended to increase significantly as the level of abuse escalated from light to heavy, although no violent behavior was reported.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark71">Criminality and Violence</a></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Links between anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse and violence have been much more difficult to establish. Most papers  suggesting  such  an  association  either  used correlative data, or discussed individual case studies. These help broaden the scope of research, but are not reliable for proving causality. For example, one study questioned a group of 23 steroid abusing men, and reported that these men were involved in a significantly greater number of verbal and even physical fights with their girlfriends and wives during the times they were administering AAS drugs.<span class="s33">246 </span>With the known effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids on aggression, this finding is compelling. It may very well be that some men are more susceptible to this type of behavior when abusing AAS than others. A paper like this is not sufficient, however, to substantiate a violent &quot;roid rage&#39;.&#39; Further research is needed to determine if AAS can even trigger violent behavior in an extremely small minority of users, and if so, what trait(s) makes these individuals susceptible to this reaction when the vast majority of users are not.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Serious criminality has also been difficult to associate with steroid abuse. When discussed, we again tend to see weak correlative data and case studies. For example, one paper in Sweden reports an association between steroid abuse and weapons and fraud crimes.<span class="s33">247 </span>It is uncertain, however, if  steroid  abuse  was  actually  responsible  for  this criminality, or just associated with it. It is simply possible</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">these men were more exposed to, or more likely to use, illegal AAS for some unidentified reason. Another paper discussed three individuals with no prior criminal or psychiatric history that were arrested for murder or attempted  murder  after  abusing  anabolic/androgenic steroids.<span class="s33">248 </span>While stories like these are interesting (and numerous), with millions of steroid users in the general population they are far from compelling.To date, there is no conclusive medical evidence that anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse can cause violent or serious criminal behavior in a previously mentally stable individual.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark72">Dependency/Addiction</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids are considered to be drugs of abuse. Although there is no universally accepted definition for this, abuse is commonly described as the continued  use  of  a  substance  in  spite  of  adverse consequences. Given the negative health consequences that are associated with supratherapeutic doses of AAS drugs, this classification is a difficult one to dispute. Drugs of abuse are very often also drugs of dependency, which in this context describes an impaired ability to control the use of a substance.There has been a longstanding debate over  whether  or  not  anabolic  steroids  also  fit  the definition of drugs of dependency. Furthermore, among those that support the notion of an anabolic steroid dependency, there is a split with regard to the nature of this dependency (psychological or physical).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Physical dependency is usually regarded as the most serious form of drug dependency, although both types can be very extreme and troubling depending on the situation. Physical dependency is defined as the need to administer a substance in order for the body to function normally. A physical dependency is usually characterized by drug tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms if the drug is discontinued abruptly.The most well known examples of drugs of physical dependency are opiates such as morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and heroin. Opiates can be very difficult drugs for dependant individuals to quit using, since stopping their use tends to produce extreme withdrawal symptoms including physical pain, sweating, tremors, changes in heart rate and blood pressure, and intense cravings for the drug. The physical symptoms may last for days to weeks after the drug is discontinued,  while  the  psychological  symptoms  can persist for months longer.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse could be associated with many of the DSM-IV criteria necessary for a diagnosis of both psychological and physical drug dependency. For instance, it is not uncommon for someone to take the drugs in higher doses or for longer periods of time then they had initially planned (criteria #1). Many abusers also</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">have a desire to cut down on their use of these drugs, but concerns over lost muscle size, strength, or performance may prevent this decision (criteria #2). Individuals often continue to abuse steroids in spite of negative health consequences  (criteria  #5).  Steroid  abuse  is  also associated  with  a  diminishing  level  of  effect  and escalating  dosages  (criteria  #6).  Lastly,  steroid discontinuance  has  been  associated  with  withdrawal symptoms  (criteria  #7),  including  reduced sex drive, fatigue,  depression,  insomnia,  suicidal  thoughts, restlessness, lack of interest, dissatisfaction with body image, headaches, anorexia, and a desire to take more steroids.<span class="s33">249</span></p><p class="s31" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;">According to the <i>American Psychiatric Association and its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM- IV), </i>three or more of the following criteria must be met for a diagnosis of psychoactive drug dependency.</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: left;">1.  Substance is taken in higher doses or for longer periods than intended.</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: left;">2.

Excessive time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from the substance.</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: left;">4. Important activities are given up because of substance abuse.</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">5.

Withdrawal symptoms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s31" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: justify;">A drug dependency that is isolated to criteria #1 to #5 would be described as psychological.The meeting of criteria #6 or #7 indicates the dependency is also a physical one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The physical benefits of anabolic/androgenic steroids complicate the matter of drug dependency a great deal. Unlike narcotics, the main motivator behind the use of steroids  is  their  positive  effect  on  muscle  and performance. With this in mind, steroid addiction could actually be a misdiagnosis for muscle dysmorphia in many cases. This is a psychological disorder characterized by persistent feelings of physical inadequacy in spite of extreme muscular development. Steroid abuse (often extreme) is highly common in muscle dysmorphics, along with compulsive resistance training.<span class="s33">250 </span>But steroid abuse is regarded as a symptom of this disorder, not a cause. In a similar sense, the physique-, strength-, and performance­ improving qualities of anabolic/androgenic steroids could</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">be driving much or all of the abuse. An analogy would be the so-called addiction to chocolate. Some individuals develop tangible psychological issues surrounding the consumption of chocolate, with uncontrolled binging and negative social and health consequences.<span class="s33">251 </span>But we do not regard chocolate itself as a substance that causes dependency.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There is some evidence that the reinforcing qualities of steroid use go beyond an attraction to their physical benefits. Lab animals such as mice and hamsters will repeatedly  self-administer  testosterone  and  other anabolic/androgenic steroids for example, an effect that cannot be caused by a perception of physical change.<span class="s33">252 </span>Testosterone  is  also  known  to  interact  with  the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is common with other drugs of abuse.<span class="s33">253 254 </span>Studies additionally suggest that  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  influence  dopamine transporter density and increase sensitivity of the brain reward  system.<span class="s33">255  </span>Steroids  are  known  to  influence psychology, and abusers commonly report an increased sense of wellness, vitality, and confidence when taking AAS drugs. Some speculate this is due in part to an inherent psychoactive effect. Further research is needed to determine if anabolic/androgenic steroids are actually mild psychoactive drugs.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark74">Anabolic/androgenic steroids are not drugs of marked intoxication,</a><span class="s33">256  </span>which makes them very different from other drugs and abuse or dependency. This makes diagnosing a drug dependency difficult. By definition, drug  dependency  is  related  to  the  abuse  of  a psychoactive substance, and it is unknown if AAS drugs can accurately be classified as psychoactive substances. At the  present  time,  most  experts  do  not  regard anabolic/androgenic steroids as drugs of true physical dependency. It is difficult to correlate the post-cycle hormone  imbalance  with  traditional  withdrawal symptoms, and tolerance is really a function of metabolic limits on muscle growth, not necessarily a diminishing biological effect. Individuals remain warned, however,that steroid abuse is commonly associated with the signs of psychological dependency. Further research is needed to evaluate  the  biological  and  psychological  nature  of steroid abuse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s54" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Deppession/Suicide</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids abuse may be associated with bouts of depression.This is most common after the administration of AAS drugs has been discontinued, especially following high doses or long cycles. During the time  that  steroids  are  being  administered,  natural hormone production is diminished because the body recognizes the excess hormone levels. When the steroid</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">drugs are abruptly discontinued, however, the body can enter a state of temporary hypogonadism (low androgen levels). This may be associated with a number of psychological symptoms including depression, insomnia, and loss of interest.This condition is usually referred to as anabolic steroid withdrawal depression, and can persist for weeks or even months as the body slowly resumes normal hormone production.<span class="s33">257</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The most common method of addressing anabolic steroid withdrawal depression in men is preemptively, with the implementation  of an aggressive post-cycle hormone recovery program.These programs are typically based on the  combined  use  of  HCG  (human  chorionic gonadotropin)  and  anti-estrogenic  drugs  such  as tamoxifen and clomiphene. They are used together in a way that can stimulate and sensitize the hypothalamic pituitary  testicular  axis,  allowing  natural  hormone production  to  return  more  quickly.  Alternately  or concurrently,  fluoxetine  (or  other  antidepressant medications) may help alleviate symptoms of depression following  steroid  withdrawal,  especially  when  this depression is prolonged or severe.<span class="s33">258 </span>These drugs must be used with caution, however, as they also have been linked  with  increased  thoughts  of  suicide  in  some patients.<span class="s33">259</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although less common, depression is sometimes reported during the active administration of anabolic/androgenic steroids. This may be caused by an imbalance of sex steroid  levels,  particularly  with  regard  to  relative androgenicity or estrogenicity. In more cases than not, it will involve a situation where sufficient androgenicity is not present, usually when primarily anabolic drugs are being taken alone. Given the diverse nature in which sex steroids interact with human psychology, however, it is difficult to clearly outline the parameters necessary for this type of depression to develop. Further confusing the issue is the fact that this depression can involve either elevated or suppressed levels of certain sex steroids. The addition of testosterone to an anabolic steroid cycle causing depression may alleviate the problem in many (but not all) instances, as it can provide both supplemental androgenic and estrogenic action.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Suicide has been linked to anabolic/steroid abuse in rare instances.<span class="s33">260  </span>Such reports are usually case studies, involving  individuals  that  were  believed  to  be psychologically stable before abusing AAS, and who committed suicide during or after use of the drugs. It is known that depression is a common complaint during anabolic steroid withdrawal. It is also known that a small percentage of users are especially sensitive to the psychological effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids,and notice dramatic mood swings, manic behavior, and/or</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark75">severe depression with their use. It is unknown why these individuals have such extreme reactions, while the vast majority of users notice only mild or moderate changes to their psychological state. Further research is needed to identify and understand these individuals. Readers are cautioned that adverse psychological effects, including severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have been associated with steroid abuse in a small minority of users. Beyond this, there is no compelling evidence suggesting that  anabolic/androgenic  steroid  abuse  will  lead  to suicide in otherwise mentally stable users.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Insomnia</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroid use may be associated with insomnia. This adverse reaction appears to be related to an imbalance of hormone levels, and has been noticed during both excess and insufficient hormonal states. For example, insomnia is a common complaint among men suffering from low androgen levels (hypogonadism).<span class="s33">261 </span>It is also frequently reported by steroid abusers during <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>post-cycle refractory period, when endogenous androgen levels are also low due to steroid-induced suppression.<span class="s33">262 </span>At the same time, this side effect is also seen during active AAS administration,<span class="s33">263 </span>when androgen levels <span style=" color: #393939;">are </span>very high. The full etiology of steroid-related insomnia is not fully  understood,  although  increased  cortisol  or diminished estrogen is commonly blamed.<span class="s33">264 265 </span>Given the complex interactions between sex steroids and the human psyche, it is difficult to predict how and when this adverse reaction will appear. While insomnia may be frequently reported among steroid users, this side effect rarely reaches a clinically significant level.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark76">Reproductive (Male)</a><a name="bookmark77">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Infertility</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroid use may impair fertility. The human body strives to maintain balance <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>its sex hormone levels (homeostasis). This balance is regulated largely  by  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular  axis (HPTA),  which  is  responsible  for  controlling  the production of testosterone and sperm.The administration of anabolic/androgenic steroids provides additional sex steroid(s) to the body, which the hypothalamus can recognize as excess. It responds to this excess by reducing signals  that  support  the  production  of  pituitary gonadotropins  luteinizing  hormone  (LH)  and  follicle- stimulating  hormone  (FSH).  LH  <span style=" color: #393939;">and  </span>FSH  normally stimulate  the  release  of  testosterone  by  the  testes (gonads), and also increase the quantity and quality of sperm. When LH and FSH levels drop, testosterone levels, sperm concentrations, and sperm quality may all be</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">reduced.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When   given   in   supraphysiological   levels, anabolic/androgenic   steroids   commonly   induce oligozoospermia.  This  is  a  form  of  reduced  fertility characterized by having less than 20 million spermatozoa per ml of ejaculate. The quality of the sperm may also be impaired under the influence of AAS, as noted by an increase in the number of abnormal or hypokinetic (noticing reduced motion) sperm. Fertility is possible during oligozoospermia, however, as viable sperm are still made by the body. The odds of conception are just significantly lower than when sperm concentrations are normal. In many cases azoospermia is reached during AAS administration, which is defined as having no measurable sperm in the ejaculate. Conception is not possible with true steroid-induced azoospermia. Note that in some cases, fertility has been temporarily restored during active anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse with the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)<span class="s33">266</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Diminished fertility is considered a reversible side effect of anabolic/androgenic steroid abuse. Sperm concentrations usually  return  to  normal  within  several  months  of discontinuing  drug  intake.  A  substantial  post-cycle recovery program based on the use of HCG, tamoxifen, and clomiphene may significantly shorten the refractory period, and is highly recommended among those in the steroid-using community. In a small percentage of cases, particularly following long periods of heavy steroid abuse, recovery of the HPTA can be very protracted, taking up to a year or longer for full recovery.<span class="s33">267 268  </span>Given the undesirable psychological and physical symptoms that can  be  associated  with  a  prolonged  state  of  low testosterone levels, such a long recovery window is rarely regarded as acceptable.

Injectable testosterone has been extensively studied by the World Heath Organization, for example, and was determined to be a safe and moderately effective method of male birth control.  In  studies  which  administered  200  mg  of testosterone  enanthate  per  week  to  healthy  men, azoospermia was achieved in 65% of patients within six months.<span class="s33">269  </span>Most  of  the  remaining  patients  were oligozoospermic.  This  diminished  fertility  was  fully reversible, and baseline sperm concentrations returned within  seven  months  on  average  after  drug discontinuance. A state of full azoospermia is the desired endpoint of male contraception, however, and this has not been reliably achieved with AAS drugs alone, even in high</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">doses.<span class="s33">270 </span>Anabolic/androgenic steroids have, likewise, are not approved for use as male contraceptives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark78">Libiiio/SeHual Dysfunction</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may alter sexual desire and functioning.The nature of their effects, however, can vary depending on the drug(s) and dosage(s) used, as well as the  individual  sensitivity  of  the  user  to  hormonal manipulation. One of the most common responses is a stimulatory one. Testosterone is the primary male sex steroid. As such, it is responsible for increasing sexual desire and supporting many male reproductive-system functions.<span class="s33">271  </span>Since all anabolic/androgenic steroids are derived from (and share similar action to) testosterone, use of these drugs is often linked to increases in sexual desire, as well as copulation and orgasm frequency.<span class="s33">272 </span><span style=" color: #393939;">A </span>significant increase in the frequency and duration of erections may also be noted.

When priapism is linked to steroid use, testosterone is usually responsible. Furthermore, this condition  appears  to  be  more  frequent  in  younger</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">patients undergoing treatment for hypogonadism.

A complete  picture  of  the  involvement  of  androgens, however, remains unclear.

Many forms of prostate cancer possess functional androgen receptors, and are highly  androgen  responsive.

Given this effect, AAS drugs are usually contraindicated in patients with a history of prostate cancer<span class="s33">285 </span>While steroid administration appears unlikely to cause prostate cancer, individuals remain warned that the use of testosterone or other AAS drugs by someone with previously undiagnosed (latent) malignant prostate cancer could result in the more rapid advancement of this disease.<span class="s33">286</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Prostale Enlargement</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids may influence the size of the prostate. Androgens are integral to the development of  the  prostate  in  early life,  and are  essential to maintaining prostate structure and function throughout adulthood. Increases in the androgen level often result in growth stimulation to this gland (prostate hypertrophy). For  example,  increased  prostate  volume  has  been reported  in  some  patients  receiving  testosterone</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">injections for the treatment of hypogonadism.<span class="s33">287 </span>While extreme  prostate  hypertrophy  is  not  common  under therapeutic conditions, prostate volume does tend to reach a size that is considered normal for a given androgen level<span class="s50">288 </span>PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels have also been shown to increase under the influence of exogenous testosterone in some patients,<span class="s33">289 </span>which is a diagnostic marker of prostate health often correlated with prostate volume.<span class="s33">290 </span><span class="s50">291 </span>Additionally, reducing stimulation of the prostate by lowering the androgen level tends to reduce prostate volume.<span class="s33">292</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic  steroid  abuse  may  result  in significant increases in prostate volume. In more severe cases, this may lead to benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH). BPH is a common condition in older men, characterized by reduced urine flow, difficulty or discomfort urinating, and changes in urinary frequency. Anecdotal reports of BPH among steroid-using bodybuilders are not common, but do occur with enough frequency to warrant concern. Such reports are most often linked to more androgenic drugs such as testosterone and trenbolone, or the excessive dosing of AAS in general. One of the most extreme reports of prostate hypertrophy came from Dr. John Ziegler, the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S.  Olympic  physician  accredited  with  introducing Dianabol to sports <span class="s50">293 </span>Dr. Ziegler noted that during the mid-1950s, many Russian weightlifters were abusing so much testosterone that they needed catheterization to urinate. Dianabol was released soon after, which is structurally  a  close  derivative  of  testosterone  with reduced androgenicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Studies of anabolic/androgenic steroid abusers show a preferential stimulation of the inner prostate under the influence ofthese drugs, in an area where benign prostate hypertrophy is known to originate <span class="s33">294 </span>In contrast, prostate cancer usually develops in peripheral areas of the gland. Some association between BPH and prostate cancer is known to exist, however, although the exact nature and strength of this association remains uncertain.<span class="s33">295 </span>PSA values are often (although not always) elevated in both disorders, and serve as a marker of potential trouble. It is important for men to monitor prostate health regularly by digital rectal examinations and blood testing for PSA levels.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroid  use  is  generally immediately discontinued if signs of BPH or elevated PSA values become apparent.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In addition to androgens, estrogens are also known to be involved in prostate growth and functioning <span class="s33">296 </span>While androgens are generally stimulatory towards prostate growth, however, estrogen exerts both protective and adverse effects <span class="s50">297 </span>On the beneficial side, stimulation of estrogen receptor (ER-beta subtype) may help protect the prostate  from  inflammation,  cell  hyperplasia,  and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark82">carcinogenesis.  Conversely,  stimulation  of  the  alpha subtype of the estrogen receptor is linked to abnormal cell proliferation, inflammation, and carcinogenesis. How the aromatization of testosterone and AAS (which will result in stimulation of both receptor subtypes) will effect prostate hypertrophy remains unclear. Prostate growth and elevated PSA values have been noted during steroid administration with both strongly and mildly estrogenic steroids.</a><span class="s33">298   </span>Furthermore,   the   administration   of anastrozole (an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis) during testosterone administration does not appear to block stimulation  of  the  prostate.<span class="s33">299  </span>Presently,  the  most successful strategy to minimizing prostate hypertrophy seems to be focused on reducing relative androgenic, not estrogenic, action.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Testicular Atrophy</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  produce  atrophy (shrinkage) of the testicles. Testosterone is synthesized and secreted by the Leydig cells in the testes. Its release is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, a system that is very sensitive to sex steroids. When anabolic steroids are administered, the HPTA will recognize the elevated hormone levels, and respond by reducing the synthesis of testosterone. If the testes are not given ample stimulation, over time they will atrophy, a process that can involve both a loss of testicular volume and shape. This atrophy may or may not be obvious to the individual. In some cases, the testes will appear normal even though their functioning is insufficient. In other cases, shrinkage is very apparent. Visible testicular atrophy is one of the most common side effects of steroid abuse, appearing in more than <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">50% </span>of all anabolic/androgenic steroid abusers.<span class="s33">300</span></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">301</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although testicular atrophy is very common in frequency, it is also regarded as a temporary reversible side effect.<span class="s33">302 </span>The gonads, by their nature, will vary in size under hormonal  influence.  Atrophy  should  not  produce permanent damage. Note, however, that it can be a somewhat persistent issue. It may take many weeks or months  of  sufficient  LH  stimulation  after  steroid discontinuance  for  original  testicular  volume  to  be restored. Likewise, testicular atrophy is usually the root cause of prolonged post-cycle hypogonadism. In extreme cases, full recovery can take more than 12 months, and may even require medical intervention. A post-cycle recovery  program  inclusive  of  HCG  (which  mimics luteinizing hormone activity) may be used to minimize this recovery phase.<span class="s33">303  </span>This drug is also frequently effective for maintaining testicular mass when used on a periodic basis during steroid administration.<span class="s33">304 </span>HCG must be used with caution, however, as overuse may cause desensitization of the testes to LH,<span class="s33">305 </span>complicating HPTA</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">recovery.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark83">Some of the more potent anabolic/androgenic steroids, including  testosterone,  nandrolone,  trenbolone,  and oxymethoIone,  appear  to  be  more  suppressive  of testosterone release than many other AAS drugs.This may be explained in part by the additional estrogenic or progestational  activity  inherent  in  these  steroids,  as estrogens and progestins both also provide negative feedback inhibition of testosterone </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">release.</span><span class="s50">306 307 </span>It is important to note, however, that all anabolic/androgenic steroids  are  capable  of  suppressing  testosterone secretion.

While these compounds  may  be  less  inhibitive  of  testosterone synthesis under some therapeutic conditions, when taken in the supratherapeutic doses necessary for physique- or performance-enhancement,  significant  atrophy  and suppression  are  common,  and  distinctions  less pronounced.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark84">Other</a></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Anaphylactoid Reactions</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">An anaphylactoid reaction is a serious and potentially life threatening allergic response to the administration of a foreign substance. Symptoms of this disorder include itching of the skin and eyes, swelling of the mucous membranes, hives, lowered blood pressure, abdominal pain, vomiting, and dilated blood vessels. The smooth muscles may also be stimulated to contract, thereby restricting breathing. Anaphylactic shock may develop in severe cases, which is marked by unconsciousness, coma, or death. The physical symptoms of this disorder are medicated by the release of histamine, leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2,and tryptase. An anaphylactoid reaction has many of the same characteristics as anaphylaxis, although is not immune system mediated. Anaphylactoid reactions  are  highly  uncommon  with  hormonal medications  such  as  anabolic/androgenic  steroids. Warnings of this reaction remain standard on many (often)  injectable  medications,  however.  Mild  skin reactions  may  be  effectively  treated  with  an antihistamine. More serious manifestations may require IV epinephrine  and  other  supportive  care.  Given  the potential for rapid escalation of this condition, immediate medical attention should be sought if an anaphylactoid reaction develops.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark85">Cancer, Brain</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids are not associated with brain cancer.

Beyond this, the effects of AAS on glucose metabolism are not fully understood, and difficult to predict.  Studies  using  supratherapeutic  doses  of testosterone and nandrolone have failed to produce any negative changes, suggesting that moderate AAS abuse is probably  not  associated  with  impairments  in  insulin sensitivity.

Clearly, the public has been given a very strong message about steroids: stay far away from them, they are deadly drugs.

Who is right? Is the isolated steroid cycle really a serious health risk? One thing that has always confounded this debate is the lack of pertinent medical studies. Medical ethics make high-dosed studies with anabolic/androgenic steroids (which may constitute abuse of the medication) very difficult to design and gain approval for. Only a very small number of clinical studies actually provide environments that could be viewed as relevant to those on both sides of the argument.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In this section, we examine three medical studies that appear highly relevant for examining real-word acute anabolic/androgenic steroid safety. They concern not therapeutic  doses,  but  a  supratherapeutic  level  and duration of intake that any illicit steroid user would recognize  as  sufficient  for  improving  muscle  mass, strength, and performance. In fact, the dosages and administration periods used in these studies reflect those taken by some of the more aggressive steroid-using bodybuilders   and   strength   athletes.   A  fairly comprehensive set of health markers were assessed during  these  three  investigations,  including  insulin sensitivity, serum cholesterol and triglyceride, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, and liver enzymes. Because of the protocols that were used, these studies give us a fairly</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">good basis to evaluate the negative health impact of anabolic/androgenic steroids, at least as it relates to an isolated cycle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark91">600 mg/wk of Testosterone</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first is a testosterone dose-response study published in the American Journal of Physiology Endocrinology and Metabolism in July of 2001, which looked at the effects of various  doses  of  testosterone  enanthate  on  body composition, muscle size, strength, power, sexual and cognitive functions, and various markers of health.<span class="s33">329 </span>61 normal men, ages 18-35, participated in this investigation. They were divided into five groups, with each receiving weekly injections of 25,50,125,300, or 600 milligrams for a period of 20 weeks.This treatment period was preceded by a control (no drug) period of 4 weeks, and followed by a recovery period of 16 weeks. Markers of strength and lean body mass gains were the greatest with larger doses of testosterone, with the 600 mg group gaining slightly over 17 pounds of fat-free mass on average over the 20 weeks of steroid therapy. There were no significant changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), liver enzymes (liver stress), sexual activity, or cognitive functioning at any dose. The only negative trait noted was a slight HDL (good) cholesterol reduction in all groups except those taking 25 mg. The worst reduction of 9 points was noted in the 600 mg group, which still averaged 34 points after</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark92">20 weeks of treatment.

Half underwent resistance training so that two groups (trained and untrained) were formed.The dosing schedule was quite formidable, beginning with 200 mg on the first week, 400 mg on the second, and 600 mg for the remaining 10 weeks of peak therapy. Doses were slowly reduced from weeks 13 to 16 to withdraw patients slowly from the drug. Potential negative metabolic changes were looked at closely, including cholesterol and lipid levels (including subfractions of HDL and LDL), triglycerides, insulin sensitivity,and fasting glucose levels. Even with the high dosages used here, no negative changes were noted in  total  or  LDL  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  or  insulin</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">sensitivity. In fact, the group also undergoing resistance exercise noticed significant improvements in LDL particle size distribution, lipoprotein(a) levels, and triglyceride values, which all indicate improved cardiovascular disease risk.  Carbohydrate  metabolism  was  also  significantly improved in this group. The only negative impact noted during  this  study  was  a  reduction  in  HDL  (good) cholesterol  values  similar  to  that  noted  with  the testosterone study, with an 8-10 point reduction noted between both groups.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark93">100 mg/day of Anadrol</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Lastly, we find a study looking at the potent oral steroid oxymethoIone (Anadrol).<span class="s33">331 </span>This steroid is thought to be one of the most dangerous ones around by bodybuilders, who as a group seem to treat it with both a lot of respect and caution. It is not common to find them exceeding the doses and intake durations of this investigation, making it a very good representation of real-world Anadrol usage. This study involves 31 elderly men, between the ages of 65 and 80. The men were divided into three groups, with each taking 50 mg, 100 mg, or placebo daily for a <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>2-week period. Changes in lean body mass and strength were measured, as well as common markers of safety including total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, serum triglycerides, PSA (prostate-specific antigen), and liver enzymes. Muscle mass and strength gains were again relative to the dosage taken, with the end results being similar to those noted with 20 weeks of testosterone enanthate therapy at 125 mg or 300 mg per week (about 6.4 and <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>2 lb of lean body mass  gained  for  the  50  mg  and  100  mg  doses respectively). There were no significant changes in PSA, total or LDL cholesterol values, or fasting triglycerides; however,  there  was  a  significant  reduction  in  HDL cholesterol values (reduced 19 and 23 points for the 50 mg and 100 mg groups respectively). Liver enzymes</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">(transaminases AST and ALT) increased only in the 100 mg group, but the changes were not dramatic, and were not accompanied  by  hepatic  enlargement  or  the development of any serious liver condition.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark94">Adding It All Up</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">One hundred and twenty-one men participated in these three studies, which involved the use of moderate to high doses of steroids for periods of three to five months. Although it may be shocking to most opponents of anabolic/androgenic steroid use, an unbiased assessment of the metabolic changes and health risks did not reveal any significant short-term dangers. The main negative impact of steroid use in all three cases was a reduction in good (HDL) cholesterol values, which is a legitimate concern when it comes to assessing one&#39;s risk for developing  cardiovascular  disease.  It  is  uncertain, however, if a short-lived increase in this particular risk factor relates to any tangible damage to one’s health over the long-term. It is also unknown how much (if any) this may be offset by the other positive metabolic changes that were seen to accompany combined AAS use and exercise.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Logic would seem to suggest that the isolated use of steroids, under parameters similar to those used in these three studies, should entail relatively minimal risks to health. At the very least, it is extremely difficult to argue that an isolated cycle with a moderate drug dose is tantamount to playing Russian roulette with your body, as most media campaigns against the use of these drugs would seem to suggest. But make no mistake.These same study results consistently demonstrated pro-atherogenic changes in blood lipids with the doses necessary for physique or performance enhancement, and underline how  it  is  that  long-term  anabolic/androgenic  steroid abuse can impair cardiovascular health.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark95">The Endocrinology of Muscle Growth</a><a name="bookmark120">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The road to anabolic insight must include a biological understanding of what muscle growth actually entails. Often simplified by the term &quot;protein synthesis&quot; muscle growth is actually a highly complex process involving much more than just building proteins from amino acids. Muscle hypertrophy, the correct scientific term for the way we adult humans build skeletal muscle, actually requires the fusion of new cells (called satellite cells) with existing muscle fibers. Since this discovery of satellite cells in 1961, a great deal of research into the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy has been undertaken. Scientists have come to understand that unlike normal muscle cells, these satellite cells can be regenerated throughout adult life. Furthermore, they serve not as functional units of their own, but provide some of the necessary components to repair and rebuild damaged muscle cells. These satellite cells are normally dormant, and sit resting in small indentations on the outer surface of the muscle fibers, waiting for something to trigger them into activation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Injury or trauma will provide the stimulus necessary to <i><b>activate </b></i>satellite cells. Once activated, they will begin to divide, multiply, and form into myoblasts (myoblasts are essentially donor cells that express myogenic genes).This stage of hypertrophy is often referred to as satellite cell <i><b>proliferation. </b></i>The myoblasts will then fuse with existing muscle fibers, donating their nuclei. This stage of the process is usually called <i><b>differentiation. </b></i>Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleated, which means they possess many nuclei. Increasing the number of nuclei allows the cell to regulate more cytoplasm, which allows more actin and myosin, the two dominant contractile proteins in skeletal muscle, to be produced.This increases the overall cell size and protein content of the muscle cell. Incidentally, the number of nuclei in relation to cross-sectional area also helps to determine the fiber type of the cell, namely slow twitch (aerobic) or fast twitch (anaerobic)<span class="s33">332 333</span>. It is important to note that we are not increasing muscle cell number with muscle hypertrophy. We are only increasing cell size and protein content, even though we are using satellite cells to help accomplish this. It is possible for myoblasts to fuse together and actually form new muscle fibers.This is called muscle hyperplasia, and equates to the legitimate growth of new muscle tissue. This is, however, not the primary mechanism of muscle growth in adult life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark96">The Anabolic Chain</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Now that we know what muscle hypertrophy is really about, let’s look at anabolic stimulus and ongoing</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark97">regulation. The following is </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>rundown of the chain of hormones  and  growth  factors  that  mediate  muscle growth, from the initiation of damage, to final recovery, repair, and growth. For the sake of organization, I have presented them in what I consider to be three logical phases of action. These are not scientifically accepted definitions. Additionally, we could continue to go deeper and  deeper  into  each  of  the  various  compounds, messengers, binding proteins, and receptors involved in this intricate and amazing biological activity. I believe the included text will demonstrate the process of muscle anabolism in a very tangible way, however, without too much unnecessary information. Each of the key areas of this section can be further researched for more detail if you are interested. For one so inclined, the medical references in the endnotes would be an excellent place to start.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trigger</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark98">We all understand that weight training is fundamental to growing muscle tissue.To date, no &quot;sit on your ass and get huge and ripped&quot; pill has been invented.The reason is that a number of changes take place in your local muscle tissues during intense training that are vital to the growth process. Without these early changes, growth is difficult if not impossible to stimulate. So for our purposes, we will start here.Training is the &quot;trigger&quot; in the anabolic process. More specifically, it is the localized cellular damage that weight training produces that will first set us down the road of anabolism.The body will respond by repairing this damage, and in the process will try to adapt by making itself stronger. Muscle growth is always a circular process, with a step back (damage) being necessary to take any steps forward.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Phase I: Initial Response</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The Initial Response phase covers those changes in muscle chemistry that begin immediately, during training, which will lay the groundwork for later repair and growth. In many regards, the Initial Response Phase will control the potential magnitude of other signals to follow. In the anabolic process, this phase is categorized by the release of arachidonic acid from muscle cells, and the formation of active messengers including prostaglandins, cytokines, leukotrienes, and prostacyclins. This begins with the breakdown of the outer phospholipid layer of muscle cells, which is initiated by the cellular disruption of damaging exercise.<span class="s33">334 </span>Phospholipases are released in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 58pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="509" height="374" alt="image" src="img/Image_030.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 195pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Fusion to Produce New Myofibers (Hyperplasia)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 103pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY AND THE 4 STAGES OF THE SATELLITE CELL CYCLE</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: center;">During the <i>Activation </i>stage, dormant satellite cells are stimulated to enter the cell cycle. <i>Proliferation </i>marks the formation of new myoblasts (active donor cells).These myoblasts will fuse with existing damaged muscle fibers during the <i>Differentiation </i>phase.This allows for greater protein synthesis and the expansion of cell size. Quiescence marks the return to a dormant state, where the inactive satellite cells will again rest on the outer layer of the fibers. Myostatin, a known inhibitor of muscle growth, is believed to be a key regulator in this stage.<span class="s62">335 </span><span class="s63">336</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">response to this trauma, which causes some of the phospholipids stored in the outer layer of the muscle cells to be released. The eccentric part of the exercise movement is of particular importance here, which is the &quot;negative&quot; part of the lift, where the muscle is stretched under resistance.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The amount of arachidonic acid, which is the central bioactive lipid in the anabolic process, liberated will largely control what occurs during this phase. Arachidonic acid is converted locally and immediately via enzymes to a number of active anabolic end products, the most notable  of  which  (in  terms  of  muscle  growth)  are prostaglandins, which are produced via interaction with cyclooxygenase enzymes. These prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGF2alpha mainly) will control much of the next phase, identified here as the Localized Tissue Priming phase. Additionally, the prostaglandin PGE2 will work to increase local nitric oxide levels, which is also an active molecule in the anabolic process. It has such actions as</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">dilating blood vessels (to increase the flow of nutrients and  hormones  to  the  muscles)  and  increasing  the production of HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) for satellite cell  activation.  Arachidonic  acid  contributes  to inflammation and pain signaling as well, and its release plays an integral role in the soreness that follows a productive bout of training.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Training intensity and the relative density of arachidonic acid  in  the  phospholipid  layer  (arachidonic  acid availability is ultimately  the rate-limiting step in the formation of anabolic prostaglandins) will dictate how much of this potent lipid can be liberated during exercise. The amount of arachidonic acid stored in skeletal muscle tissue is also in a state of constant flux. A number of factors are involved with its regulation, the most notable of which are dietary intake and daily utilization. Regular resistance training depletes arachidonic acid stores, replacing it with other, more abundant,fatty acids.<span class="s33">337 </span>With less arachidonic acid available, the responsiveness of the prostaglandin</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">system to regular exercise starts to diminish.<span class="s33">338 </span><i><b>Have you ever wondered why you were so sore when you first start training, or after you took a long break?

We have a hormone or growth factor on one</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">ones, where you struggle to notice even moderate soreness? <span class="p">hand, such as testosterone, IGF-1, MGF, or insulin, and its</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark99">Much of this is directly tied to your arachidonic acid stores.The more arachidonic acid you have, the easier it is to liberate during training, and vice versa.Thankfully, levels can be augmented with dietary intervention (for more information, see the arachidonic acid profile).</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phase II: Localized Tissue Priming</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Phase II is characterized by a localized increase in growth factor  expression  and  tissue  sensitivity  to  anabolic hormones.  Those  who  have  always  wondered  why anabolic drugs do not work without training will find a good explanation right here. Simply put, your muscles need to be primed for the actions of these drugs first. One way the body accomplishes this is to increase the density of certain receptors in those specific muscles (fibers really) where it needs to initiate repair. This includes, among others, androgen, IGF-1, MGF, and insulin receptors. Stretch-induced muscle damage and the Phase <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>response are  both  principle  triggers  here.  Receptor  density regulation is important because it prevents anabolic hormones from stimulating tissue growth in areas of the body that  do not require it. Receptor density can, therefore,  be  as  strong  a  regulating  force  on  the pharmacological activity of anabolic drugs as the serum levels of the drugs themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">corresponding receptor on the other. Injecting exogenous anabolic drugs facilitates greater receptor binding and anabolic  signaling  by  providing  more  messenger hormones/growth  factors  (obviously).  The  more hormones or growth factors you have around the cell, the more binding and activation of receptor sites will take place. We cannot forget, however, that having more receptor sites (instead of more hormones) can also facilitate the process too. More receptors mean the existing hormones or growth factors will find them faster. Faster binding means the anabolic message is sent more quickly, and once completed that the anabolic messenger will be more likely to find another receptor site (to send another message) before it is broken down by enzymes. It is all about how much signal can be sent in a given time period, and both sides of the equation are equally important in determining this.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">While on one hand we have an increase in tissue sensitivity to anabolic hormones and growth factors, also vital during the Localized Tissue Priming phase is an increase in the localized expression of certain vital growth factors themselves.This includes IGF-1, MGF, FGF, HGF.TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. These compounds will be released, and will work together on the existing damaged muscle fibers and satellite cells, in a sort of grand symphony of muscle anabolism, with each playing its own vital role in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="340" height="268" alt="image" src="img/Image_031.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Note: Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme with anti-inflammatory    drugs    like    ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin, prevents the formation of active prostaglandins. The anabolic cascade is stalled without  sufficient  prostaglandin  formation  (Am  J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 282:E551 -6), interfering with the normal increase in protein synthesis rates after exercise. It is often advised to use such drugs only when necessary if muscle growth is a key focus.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark100">process. In many cases, the actions of one compound will support  the  other,  either  by  enhancing  its  levels, suppressing restricting binding proteins, or supporting its signaling  via  intertwined  mechanisms.  A  detailed roadmap to all such interactions would go well beyond the scope of this book, and in fact are as of yet not even fully understood to science. A general overview of what is going on with each compound itself, however, is provided in our review of Phase III.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Phase III: Repair</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Your local muscle tissues are primed during Phases I and II.During Phase III,the hormones and growth factors goto work to finish the job. We categorize this phase as one of ongoing  anabolic  action,  action  mediated  by  the combined effects of many anabolic hormones and growth factors including androgens, insulin, IGF-1, IGF-2, MGF, FGF, HGF,TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. This is the time when repair and hypertrophy are physically taking place in your muscles, and each compound will play an intricate role in the process. We must not forget, however, that everything leading up to this point (the actions in Phase <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>&amp; II) has still been determining how strong the growth response will be, via modifying receptor densities and hormone/growth factor expression. We will follow the individual actions of the anabolic components very closely here. During the third phase, tissue repair and growth will be finalized with the help of the following hormones and growth factors.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s5">Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF): </span>HGF is a heparin- binding growth factor that resides on the outer surface of uninjured cells.

If the above seems confusing to you, it should. The fact is,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">the  whole  process  of  muscle  growth  has  been confounding scientists for decades, and undoubtedly will for decades more. We still have a great way to go before being  able  to  explain  fully  how  it  is  that  muscle hypertrophy occurs in humans. But as you can see, we have traveled a great distance as well. During the mid- 1960s, scientists were only first learning that we grow muscle with the help of satellite cells. More than forty years later we have identified, and are experimenting with, dozens of growth factors that were unheard of back then.lt is a new world today, and despite not having all the answers,  we  know  enough  to  enhance  human performance in many exciting new ways. But please don&#39;t mistake the intention of this section. It is not here to give you a functional roadmap of the entire anabolic process, or to guide you in the ultimate polydrug program. It is here simply to open your mind to the true complexity of anabolism. When we start to see muscle growth from its various angles and intricacies, we begin to see our own potential opportunities for successful exploitation. How many of these opportunities you act upon will depend on your own goals and interests. But no matter how much or how little you actually apply this information, I hope you feel better equipped by having it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 95pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="456" height="263" alt="image" src="img/Image_032.gif"/></span></p><p class="s64" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 165pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">(prostaglandins, mechano-growth factor)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Skeletal muscle growth is a complex process that involves a variety of signaling compounds.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark102">Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Induced Hypogonadism (ASIH):A Unique Type of Hypogonadism</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark103">Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS)- the Good News and the Bad News</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is estimated that the numbers of anabolic steroid (AAS) users  has  tripled-most  notably among young  users- from one to three million since these agents were declared illegal in 1991. In contrast to AAS use by the professional athletes of media headlines, the largest AAS using group are now middle class men who do not compete in any sport: 75% of users state that their use is for purely cosmetic reasons, primarily a lean and muscular body. (Endocrine Review, Dec 2013) The development of AAS,  including  at  least  100  synthetic  relatives  of testosterone and a reported 15-25% of AAS contaminated dietary supplements advertised as AAS free (Pope &amp; Brower, 2008), has made it possible to enhance attempts to create this ideal body-- to increase muscle mass and strength,  and  promote  leanness,  while  decreasing recovery time and improving healing. However, as their hyphenated description indicates, AAS isn&#39;t only about anabolism (muscle building). Users must also contend with their androgenic (male sex hormones) effects. Thus, there have been many attempts to pharmacologically dissociate the desired anabolic actions of AAS from the unwanted  androgenic  side  effects-especially  those accompanying   high   doses   of   these   agents (Langenbucher....). Some of these androgenic effects include hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, renal failure, inhibition of  reproductive  function,  oligiospermia/azoospermia which  threaten  fertility;  hypogonadism—decreased production of natural testosterone, leading to lability in libido  and  mood;  acne  and  loss  of  hair;  physical feminization of males, e.g., gynecomastia which, when severe, can require surgery (Langenbucher et al, 2008; Sullivan, in Kuhn, 2010; Rahnema et al, 2015). Some of these side effects of AAS may be transient, resolving when AAS use is ended. However, they can also cause long- lasting or permanent end organ damage. (Rahnema et al, 2015) For example, high doses of AAS, over long periods of time, have been shown to have multiple long lasting effects on the cardiovascular system. A prime example of such cardiovascular effects are bodybuilders who typically use AAS in doses up to one hundred times greater than the normal body amount, risking clumping platelets in the heart and potentially triggering strokes and heart attacks. Even after stopping AAS there may be a decrease in left ventricular function, leading to heart failure.

Thus, there has been little clinical guidance for physicians about AAS and concomitant medical conditions. Acknowledging this, Rahnema and colleagues cautioned that the &quot;unique pharmacological milieu&quot; resulting from long term AAS use was such that &quot;medical testosterone which is given for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), at a fixed replacement dose, may  not  be  a  good  model  to  describe  the pharmacodynamics of AAS.&quot; In their systematic review of AAS, based on interviews with hypogonadal users as well as research and clinical experience reported between 1965 and 2013, these authors have provided insight into what is now known about ASIH, and about evidence based treatments. Systematic reviews such as theirs are especially valuable because of the judgmental overlay which some believe has influenced under-treatment of AAS users. Such reviews &quot;explicitly aim to limit systematic error (bias), mainly attempting to identify, appraise and synthesize all relevant studies (of whatever design) in order to answer a particular question (or set of questions)&quot; (Schlosser, J, 2006).The questions, which Rahnema and his colleagues  sought  to  answer,  concerned  the pathophysiology of AAS, and safe, effective ways to treat related medical conditions in current and past users.Their findings validated what other experts had previously reported , i.e., that cyclical depletion of endogenous testosterone  during  long  term  self-dosing  of supraphysiologic AAS (synthetic testosterone and other anabolic  steroids),  results  in  a  unique  form  of hypogonadism,  an  acquired  inability  of  the  HPT  to produce  the  body&#39;s  natural  testosterone-Anabolic- Androgenic Steroid Induced Hypogonadism (ASIH).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Rahnema and his colleagues also provided support for treatment protocols which have been endorsed by other experts, and which will be described later in this article.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Unique AAS milieu and ASIH : It&#39;s About Sex</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">As a physician who has spent years researching medical issues related to AAS in both the ivory tower and the iron gym,  always  maintaining  a  non-judgmental  attitude toward users, I have had the good fortune to treat thousands of men who are completely open with me about their use. For 90% of these men who seek out my medical services regarding a specific health issue related to using AAS, there is something related to sex in their motivation. It&#39;s axiomatic that, after years of AAS use, a man&#39;s testosterone will be low. Their low testosterone state, in most AAS users&#39; cases related to ASIH, leads to a lower threshold for symptoms, e.g., poor libido, which is more  severe  than  in  a  man  with  &quot;organic&quot;  low testosterone. (Kelleher, 2004) The mechanism-of-action (MOA) for this difference is unknown. We do know that injecting esters of testosterone in higher doses than standard testosterone replacement doses, for prolonged periods, leads to chronic higher free testosterone states in the central nervous system (CNS). These chronic high levels of free testosterone cause changes in parts of the CNS that may lead to dependency on super physiologic testosterone  doses  for  optimal  sexual  experience. &quot;Chronically consumed high doses of AAS are postulated to stimulate brain reward systems in humans,and to result in neuroadaptations in other brain systems that manifest as  withdrawal  symptoms  (e.g.,  poor  libido)  upon discontinuation&#39;.&#39; (Wood, 2004). Over time, it is also likely that there will be permanent damage in these and other areas, contributing to severe low libido states when AAS are stopped. (Kanayama, 2015)</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark105">When the Music Stops</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Men, even young men with normal testosterone levels, experience increased libido on steroids. However, the operant word here is &quot;on&quot;; any experienced steroid user learns quickly that sex &quot;on&quot; steroids vs. &quot;off&#39;) is very different.  In  the  beginning,  most  steroid  users, with/without  Post  Cycle  Therapy  (drugs  taken  to counteract the androgenic effects of AAS) experience only minimal side effects regarding sex. Over time, however-- whether in cycling or in attempts to stop using­</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">- the hypogonadal state created by AAS can cause poor libido, impotence, infertility, severe depression, and even suicidality during withdrawal. (Brower, 2009)</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">To try to understand the relationship between AAS and the sexual issues which are paramount in ASIH, we must understand the dynamics of some of the most widely</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">used agents. In addition to a variety of testosterone based agents,  e.g.,  Testosterone  Cypionate,  Enanthate, Propionate, there are testosterone derived drugs like Dianabol   and   Boldenone.   There   are   also Dihydrotestosterone DHT derived agents like Anadrol and Anavar, and the 19-nortestosterone (19-nor) AAS agents like Deca-Durabolin and Trenbolone. Each of these agents has chemical effects specific to its mechanisms, which affect a man&#39;s sexual function. However, they ALL share one effect, mediated by the HPT: They will ALL shut down a man&#39;s natural testosterone production while taking the drug. Specific drugs, doses and individual user profile will influence the severity of this inevitable hypogonadal outcome. For example, drugs like Trenbolone and Deca- Durabolin are known to be very suppressive to the HPT— hence, the classic term since the 197O&#39;s,&quot;Deca Dick&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The method of action (MOA) for this severe shutdown may  be  related  not  only  to  the  suppression  of endogenous testosterone, but also to the fact that Deca Durabolin is reduced to dihydronandrolone (DHN) as opposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) which, along with endogenous testosterone, binds with androgen receptors in the brain to support libido in a naturally intact male. When  DHN  then  crosses  the  blood-brain-barrier, interacting with androgen receptors in the brain, it may either compete with DHT and testosterone or act as a direct antagonist, causing inhibitory actions, resulting in a low libido state. We also know that 19-nor drugs like Deca Durobolin  and  Trenbolone,  which  are  synthetic progestins, can cause increased prolactin production, which can lead to diminished libido and non-optimal CNS dopaminergic states. (Web MD) The &quot;Bro Science&quot; remedy for this, widely published on AAS websites and forums, has been to take greater parts of testosterone-to-nandrolone doses; most experienced users recommend 1.5 to 2/1 ratio. And this works--for a time. Men almost never take a nandrolone agent like Deca orTren without testosterone. And when they are&#39;&#39;on”these drugs, sexual performance is usually not only preserved, but most men say they are hypersexual  during  this  time.  It  appears  that  the combination of a 19-nor drug and testosterone esters provides &quot;over stimulation&quot;to the sexual areas of the brain; at least for a period of time. Then things can come crashing down! The CNS, which is dynamic, always in flux, tries  to  maintain  balance  in  reaction  to  continuous stimulation, including various and changing hormonal chemistry(s).Thus,as AAS provide initial stimulation of the androgen receptors in the brain there is an upswing in libido, only to be followed by a crash as the body reacts to restore balance in the face of these artificial forces. Although it is true that some men can live on fixed doses of testosterone/nandrolone for prolonged periods and maintain a good libido, as we have discussed in this article,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">the likely health consequences of living on two AAS&#39;s must be considered.The same is true for using net super­ physiologic doses of androgen over prolonged periods, the effects of which are known to cause serious health issues.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In addition to the suppressive nature of AAS on HPT, related imbalances in other hormones also play a role in the pathophysiology of how AAS affect sex. These hormones/ratios include estrogen/androgen, prolactin (as discussed above in the case of the nandrolone based AAS),  DHT,  and  other  CNS  neurotransmitters  like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and GABA. &quot;... the potential variability of molecular and cellular effects of the AAS in the brain and suggest that the range of actions of these steroids will be highly complex, depending not only upon the chemical signatures and concentrations of the different  AAS  taken,  but  also  upon  region-specific differences in AR (Androgen receptors), ERalpha, ERbeta, and  aromatase  expression  and  changes  in  the endogenous steroid environment that occur as a function of sex, age and hormonal state.&quot;(Penatti et al, 2009)</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">This  complexity  is  demonstrated  anecdotally  by  the thousands of interviews I have had with men who use AAS and/or who are on testosterone replacement. When I attempted to assess their sexual response to these agents, I was amazed at the variability, and the sometimes- paradoxical responses. Some men told me that they feel best on 1,500 mg of AAS a week, while others reported that just 2 days after a physiological replacement dose of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">100 mg testosterone Cypionate, their libido is poor, and they feel best just prior to the next injection nadir. Clearly, sexual response to these agents is no simple formula.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Many men, who use AAS chronically,also use a drug called Dostinex to block the effects of elevated prolactin levels secondary to AAS, and to improve libido. However, the side effects of this drug which is a dopamine promoter used  for  hyperprolactinemic  disorders  either  from unknown medical conditions or from pituitary growths, can be serious and can lead to other medical conditions, e.g„ hypotension, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, fertility issues and severe mood disorders (Web MD). Is it worth it? A drug for a drug, for yet another drug?</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In my clinical practice, I have also observed that men living on AAS and even on physiologic testosterone have poor erections at times, despite a perfectly balanced hormonal milieu. Kanayama et al (2015) found a subset of AAS users treated for ASIH showed continued loss of sexual desire and erectile dysfunction even when normal testosterone levels were restored. &quot;Such cases may possibly represent end organ resistance-reflecting a possibly irreversible down-regulation  of  androgen  receptors  or  androgen</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">receptor signaling mechanisms.&quot; Since almost 100 % of men on chronic AAS and testosterone replacement have atrophied testicles, they can suffer from a venous leak state that can lead to poor quality erections. A urologist colleague explained it to me like this,&quot;The testicles are like dampers at the base of the penis, when the testicle is shrunken and atrophied, the ability to hold back blood in the erect engorged penis may be reduced, leading to a leak-like situation and poor sustained quality erections&#39;!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark106">Withdrawal Syndrome</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Inseparable from the issue of ASIH, the shutdown of a man&#39;s HPT when he is on steroids, is the issue of what happens when he comes off them, during cycling or in a cessation attempt. For most men, being on AAS leads to either ok or great sex, but remember, as discussed above, the specific user hormonal profile, the type of AAS and ancillary drugs, the specific combinations and doses of these, all play a role in one&#39;s sexual experience on AAS. It&#39;s when a man stops AAS that everything falls apart- regardless of what agents were used. This is what the average user does not know or understand-or consider when making the choice to use.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">What is going on here? The HPT, which has been dormant while on AAS, has to start back up again when AAS is removed from the system. This takes time; and for men who have been on AAS for prolonged periods or have used high doses, or very suppressive AAS, the restoration of the HPT may be delayed for months or years, or as noted earlier, in some circumstances may never return, despite  medical  intervention.(Rahnema  et  al,  2014; Kanayama et al, 2015) The most distressing symptoms of the withdrawal state- poor libido and mood, impotence, severe depression and suicidality— can be so severe as to create a state of dependency in users who are compelled by  these  to  resume  use.  When severe,  withdrawal symptoms caused by ASIH can not only compromise attempts to end AAS use as they prompt re-use, but they have also been shown to cause the palliative use of other illegal substances, e.g., opiates as well. (Kanayama G et al, 2010). The gravest danger during the AAS withdrawal period is severe depression and suicidality, with 12% of users in withdrawal experiencing severe depression, and 5% attempting suicide. (Brower 2009) It is not only the severity of withdrawal symptoms, notably in libido and mood, but also the fear of these which can compel re-use; hence, the cycle of dependency. (Brower, 2009; Rahnema et al, 2014) Dependency is believed to affect between 15­ 30% of AAS users (JAMA, 2013), with AAS considered to be more addictive than cocaine. (Phillips, 2010) Because of these high rates of dependence, several experts proposed including  AAS  among  the  addictive/dependence substances in the Diagnostic Standard Manual.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">(Kanayama et al, 2009). The take home message here is that  withdrawal  syndrome  is  the  MOST  COMMON REASON WHY MEN DO NOT AND CANNOT STOP USING</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">STEROIDS; why they are compelled to stay on steroids for prolonged periods, and even for life.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark107">The  mechanism  of   operation  regarding  the pathophysiology of AAS withdrawal state is not fully understood, but may relate to the fact that during use the hypothalamus and pituitary go into a dormant state called apoptosis (programmed cell death) (Hartgen &amp; Kuipers, 2004), so that their production of gonadotropins, e.g, LH and ESH is either inadequate or qualitatively deficient to produce sustained testicular testosterone. To counter this  disease process which lies  somewhere between the hypothalamus, the pituitary and cells that produce testosterone in the testicles, AAS users have used a treatment protocol called Post Cycle Therapy (PCT) over the past 3 decades in an attempt to hasten the restoration of the HPT and to minimize the devastating physiological and psychological effects of ASIH in the post- use period.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Post-Cycle Therapy (PCT)</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The medical agents used for PCT are fertility medications of  the  class  Selective  Estrogen  Receptor  Modulator (SERM), e.g, Tamoxifen and Clomid, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin  (HCG)  and  various  anti-estrogen medications,  e.g,  Arimidex  and  Letrozole.  There  is impressive support from experts for the medical use of these  agents  to  support  cessation  by  ameliorating withdrawal  symptoms  during  treatment  focused  on restoring  HPT  and  production  of  endogenous testosterone.  (Talih,  F  et  al,/Cleveland  Clinic,2007; Hochberg et al, 2003; Spratt, 2012; Pope &amp; Brower, 2008; Rahnema et al, 2014). However, <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>should be stated that although it is ethical for a physician to use these agents to assist any man coming off AAS, neither medical use nor various PCT regimens, has been shown to produce sustainable endogenous testosterone levels or quality libido states in men who have used AAS chronically. Again, while medical PCT is 100% ethical, it may not work in blocking the effects of AAS used over long periods of time. I have had a number of men who have used AAS say to me, &quot;Doc, I did my PCT, but now I feel terrible and my testosterone and sex is down! What happened? Why didn&#39;t the PCT work?&quot;The answer is, we just don&#39;t know.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The following comment, which appeared on a highly regarded anabolic steroids blog regarding PCT, indicates the persistence of an overly sanguine view of the pathway back to normal following AAS use:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">&quot;Once the use of the AAS is complete and all of the exogenous steroidal hormones have cleared</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">your system, natural testosterone recovery will begin again. Natural recovery assumes no prior low testosterone condition. It also assumes no damage was done to the HPTA (HPT) due to improper AAS use. While natural recovery will occur on its own, it will be slow. For this reason, most are encouraged to implement a PCT plan after AAS use. Such a plan will commonly include the SERM&#39;s Nolvadex and Clomid, and often- additional HCG.This will greatly speed up the recovery process, as well as its overall efficiency. It will not return your natural testosterone levels to normal on its own. If this is something you&#39;ve been told, (know that) it is <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>myth. However, it will ensure you have testosterone for proper bodily function while your levels continue to naturally rise.Total recovery will still take months, but this will cut the total time down dramatically and ensure a smooth recovery.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark108">Such views do not consider what we now know about the potentially  ravaging  long  term  and  even  permanent effects of ASIH in patients suffering the consequences of long term, high dose AAS use. It&#39;s important to discourage such unsupported notions about an automatic restart button after AAS use—especially since a significant number of high school students—the fastest growing group of users- do not believe these agents (AAS) are harmful (DOJ, 2004).</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ASIH: Threat to Cessation</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While   a   complete   explanation   for   AAS dependency/addiction  is  not  yet  fully  understood, similarities  to  the  neurological  pathway  of  opioid addiction have been reported. (Wood, 2008; Caraci et al, 2007)  Sexual  and  other  physiological  symptoms  of withdrawal, e.g., flu, mood, whether in cycling or in attempts to end use, were described some time ago by experts  who  noted  that  these  were  probably  an endocrine effect of the episodic nature of use and discontinuance  (cycling).  (Kashkin  &amp;  Kleben,  1989; Hochberg, 2003). A component part of the explanation of dependency is the psychological explanation that when steroid use stops, muscle development is limited, and related feelings of power and self-esteem are impacted. Co-morbid conditions such as pre-existing depression and Body Dysmorphia are also thought to contribute to dependency. (Leone et al, 2005) This complex symptom profile causes AAS dependency to differ significantly from that of other addictive drugs which are valued primarily for the &quot;high&quot; they produce. Thus, it is clear that, while education is seen by some as an important component in prevention/cessation  efforts,  as  with  other  addictive drugs, it is not sufficient for safe and effective AAS</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">withdrawal when a man is seeking cessation.This complex and well characterized AAS withdrawal syndrome has now been described as a major factor in the development of AAS dependence, as dysphoric withdrawal effects lead to resumption of AAS use for relief. (Kanayama et al, 2009; Bhasin et al, 2013; Brower, 2009) Brower (2009) notes that the physiological nature of dependency on AAS can be diagnosed by asking what happens when a patient tries to stop using AAS. He cautions,&quot;Conventional methods of treating substance abuse are usually inappropriate unless modified specifically for AAS users&quot; Despite such cautions, treatment for AAS dependence continues to be modelled after other substance dependence: a recent description of treatment offered for Steroids Addiction at a well known, and expensive residential treatment center stated, &quot;(Our) Steroids addiction treatment is largely psychological in nature to deal with the user&#39;s psychological dependence on  the  drug..(therefore)  the  primary  treatment  is behavioral therapy&#39;.&#39;Completely misses the boat.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A parallel criticism could be leveled at physicians who, because of their lack of understanding of ASIH, rely on unrepresentative  studies  of  other  hypogonadic populations to inform their treatment of AAS users. The supraphysiologic  doses  required  for  anabolic  effect (muscle building), which are widely available on the Internet without prescriptions, along with advice on how to  use  them  for  maximum  effect,  far  exceed  the recommended physiological dose that ethical physicians administer for hypogonadism. Thus, the results of studies in which, for ethical reasons, AAS subjects received only physiologic dose of testosterone over short periods of time do not provide useful guides for treating AAS related conditions such as ASIH. Clearly, such studies are not representative of men who have used AAS-of all kinds, including neurotoxic substances—in doses 10-100 times greater than those given to study samples, cycling these substances  over  years,  not  weeks  or  months,  and presenting with serious AAS related co- morbid medical conditions. (Mechanics., 2016) Yet, because of the lack of prospective  studies  using  supraphysiological  doses- which would be unethical- many physicians continue to base their treatments on these. Extrapolating from such studies  to  men  presenting  with  ASIH  is  not  only inappropriate,  but  one  could  also  reasonably  say unethical inasmuch as we now have available therapeutic agents shown to be safe and effective for relieving the severest symptoms of ASIH. &quot;Cold turkey&quot; prescriptions like &quot;stop the drugs immediately and await recovery in patience&quot;  which  astonishingly  appeared  in  an  major journal article as recently as 2016,(Mechanic et al, 2016) are now neither appropriate nor necessary as they do not tally  with  either  compassion  nor  evidence  based medicine. Because of the potential severity of symptoms</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">accompanying withdrawal, &quot;cold turkey&quot; cessation is not recommended, as abrupt cessation of AAS and waiting until  natural  testosterone  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">levels  </span>return,  unaided  by medication, leaves the body &quot;wide open to hormonal collapse&quot; (Turek, 2015). No physician should risk a patient&#39;s health in this way.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Because of the unique pathophysiology of ASIH which distinguishes  hypogonadic  AAS  users  from  other substance abusers, as well as from other hypogonadic populations,  treatment  protocols  used  by  physicians familiar with this condition differ significantly from those used by physicians who are not as informed. It is generally recommended that withdrawal from AAS be supported by hormonal replacement therapy, tapering hormones down over time, and continuing until recovery of the hypothalmic-pituitary-gonadal    axis.    Management strategies that are recommended include testosterone replacement   therapy   (TRT),   human   chorionic gonadotropin  (hCG),  and  selective  estrogen  receptor modulators (SERMs) to restore the HPT axis and its ability to  produce  endogenous  testosterone.  (Talih  et  al, Cleveland Clinic, 2007; Hochberg et al, 2003; Spratt, 2012; Pope &amp; Brower, 2008; Rahnema et al, 2014) However, there is no guarantee, even with medical assistance, of when-or if—the HPT axis will recover. Persistence of hypogonadism even after drug cessation is &quot;probably the result of long term adaptation to hormones which may involve  relatively  persistent  changes  in  molecular switches.&quot; (Hochberg, 2003) Recovery can take place in months, or can be quite prolonged, with ASIH persisting years after cessation, or it can be irreversible, depending on the damage done to the HPT during use (Kanayama et al, 2010; Borogowda et al, 2001). Rahnema et al (2014) have warned that failure to treat ASIH could result in permanently failed HPT axis. Such a case has been described by Stephens et al (201<span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">1).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Medications  such  as  those  listed  above  to  relieve withdrawal symptoms and assist HPT recovery have been found to be both effective and safe in physiologic doses. McLaren et al (2008) found that short-term (up to 5 years) TRT resulted in minimal prostatic growth or development of lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms. Morgantaler (2010) has reported that the use of physiological dose of testosterone to restore the body to hormonal balance presents no significant medical risks:&quot;While side effects of physiological  dose  testosterone  can  include  some elevation of red blood count, with no reported stroke or other adverse effects; and some minor swelling and some acne breakouts, these effects go away as soon as treatment is stopped.&quot;</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 75%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark109">When ASIH Requires Long-Term Testosterone Replacement</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Almost all AAS related sexual issues will be related to libido. I find it puzzling that so many doctors give AAS users Viagra for their sexual issues, when it is 100% useless! A AAS user&#39;s poor libido is not a failure of the man&#39;s penis to produce nitric oxide. In most cases, a user&#39;s poor libido will be the result of ASIH as his CNS has adapted to higher levels of androgen while on AAS. As discussed above, the HPT is the main player here, and even with PCT, the shortest amount of time <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>man can expect to gain full restoration of the HPT is 3-6 months. If he still has a poor libido at that point he should consider the possibility of more severe ASIH, and seek a medical expert for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">SERMS such as those mentioned earlier may help a man suffering with AAS related sexual issues. However, if these do not work, a man who has been living on AAS for years and finds that he cannot get off AAS due to lack of libido, may have to be considered for life- long physiologic testosterone replacement therapy. The seriousness of this choice of treatment for ASIH cannot be overstated. If the therapy choice is physiologic testosterone replacement (TRT), this may be for life, with not only considerable expense  and  inconvenience,  but  also  with  potential implications for cardiovascular and prostate health, and other medical issues, such as the following, which have been associated with testosterone:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cardiovascular Disease: How testosterone is connected to heart disease is complex and multifactorial, but very real! Focusing on this is an important part ofTRT treatment and also for men using AAS. AAS (including testosterone) have been shown to worsen existing heart disease risk factors such as hypertension, poor lipid ratios--higher LDL and low HDL, and to cause obstructive sleep apnea, which can lead an enlarged heart and heart failure. Other risks include increasing red blood cell indices, hypercoagulable states and direct adverse effect on the heart muscle itself (cardiomyopathy), and damage to the endothelial aspect of the artery(s)-leading to plaque progression and the potential for a heart attack. (Morgantaler et al (2015). Since beginning my medical practice in 2005,1 have seen many men with premature heart disease secondary to AAS use. This disease state can take decades to progress, and men with poor family histories associated with early and severe heart disease are especially at risk. Identifying these risk factors early is very important because, in addition to supporting  safe  and  effective  AAS  discontinuation, physicians can play a very important role in providing protective medicines while someone is going through a dangerous period of use.

Give a man time to make the right decision, and prevent him from having a heart attack, has always been my perspective.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark110">Prostate Disease: While the debate about a connection between prostate disease and the cumulative effects of long term testosterone treatment, no conclusion has been reached. Following the FDA warning regarding these, Nam &amp; Wallis (2016) presented the findings of their own study which  involved  over 38,000  men,  both  treated and untreated, and which not only found no increase in prostate risk in treated men over 5 years, but found that risk decreased with long term exposure. However, the design of the study has been criticized by other experts who continue to advise caution. Since there are no long­ term studies of men on testosterone treatment, it is reasonable to exercise caution in providing testosterone treatment of men with family history of prostate disease or pre-existing malignancy.Current recommendations are to exclude prostate cancer before initiating TRT in men over age 40 and to closely monitor men in the first year of testosterone  replacement,  followed  by  observation  in subsequent years.

ASIH is evidenced by both clinical symptoms such as those cited earlier, and somewhat less reliably by laboratory levels of testosterone, as is standard practice when treating hypogonadism. Lab levels, generally, have been  challenged  on  both  validity  and  reliability  in diagnosing hypogonadism. As a result, attempts are being made to improve reliability by standardizing lab procedures (Wartofsky &amp; Handelsmann, 2012). Validity of lab numbers in individual cases, however, remains a strongly debated issue. Several experts assert that while what constitutes a functionally&quot;normal&quot;testosterone level is consistent within a particular man,&quot;normal&quot; levels differ &quot;significantly&quot; between men.( Kelleher et al, 2004) Just as there is now broad consensus on medications required to assist in recovery of HPT system in ASIH patients, there is also growing support for evaluating recovery of the HPT axis on the basis of symptom recovery, and not solely on lab levels of testosterone. Zitzmann and Nieschlag (2000) have defined recovery of HPT axis as return to sexual health, which they define as ’(..restoration of libido, increase  in  sexual  fantasies,  and  the  frequency  of erections were considered signs of adequate therapy , while  symptoms  such  as  lethargy,  inactivity  and depressed mood indicated less than adequate therapy&quot; A five year study by Kelleher et al, (2004) of the variability of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark111">testosterone thresholds in hypogonadal men receiving TRT  provides  objective  evidence  to  support  &quot;...the common  clinical  practice  of  monitoring  adequacy  of androgen replacement therapy by observing how well the presenting symptoms are rectified.&quot; An essential implication of such studies, which validate the importance of symptoms as indicators of ideal testosterone levels -of adequate  restoration  of  HPT  axis-underscores  the important  role  of  clinical  judgment  as  a  guide  to treatment. Morgantaler &amp; Conners (2013) concur: &quot;Since there  is  no  serum  testosterone  value  that  reliably identifies men who will respond to treatment from those who will not, healthcare providers must exercise clinical judgment  in  making  the  diagnosis  of  testosterone deficiency..&quot; These authors caution that assuming a certain number indicates normal testosterone level can cause a physician to falsely assume that the problem lies elsewhere. Finkelstein et al (2013) have recommended a continuum, rather than a rigid threshold above, which clinical measures are normal and below which adverse change  occurs.  Clearly,  diagnosis  and  recovery  of androgen deficiency, ASIH, are not simple matters of recording &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; lab testosterone levels, but are more  validly  inferred  from  individual  symptom report/response, i.e., subjective as well as objective.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Looking Ahead</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Because of the multi-system side effects of AAS, its unique pathophysiology, and the added complication of patient­ specific use patterns, it is important for physicians to ask patients  directly  about  use  in  order  to  provide appropriate treatment, and to counsel about cessation. 56% of AAS users have never disclosed their use to doctors; their reasons include not believing doctors are informed on AAS, fear of possible legal consequences of acknowledging use, and the belief by some users that these agents are not harmful. (Pope &amp; Brower, 2004) Failing to ask patients directly about use can lead to masking the underlying cause of many health problems, including hypogonadism and infertility. Asking about AAS use should be part of the routine medical workup of all hypogonadal men. Specific questions should include: dates of first and last use; the names and doses of AAS used; sources of drugs (legal or prescription); routes of administration,e.g., needle sharing; patterns of use, e.g., stacking, cycling. Also of interest should be other drug combinations used to: augment AAS effects (human growth hormone, insulin, Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMS), peptides and clenbuterol);to reduce unwanted side effects-post cycle therapy PCT (clomid, human  chorionic  gonadotropin  HCG,  tamoxifen,  and various anti-estrogens); to mask urine testing (probenicid, diuretics); and use of other illicit drugs, e.g., opiods (Pope</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&amp; <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Brower, 2008).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When physicians do not inquire about AAS in cases of infertility, despite the fact that male infertility has been linked to prior or current steroid use, a couple may be unnecessarily led into an expensive-between fifteen and thirty  thousand  dollars  out  of  pocket-and  potentially frustrating course(s) of fertility treatment. (Kirby EW, et al, 2016) AAS related male infertility which can sometimes be long-term, or even irreversible, has also caused <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>significant number of men who have used AAS to later express regret because they had not known that elevated serum testosterone levels obtained from AAS result in oligospermia and azoospermia. (Kovac, JR et al, 2014) It&#39;s not clear that enough physicians know that either, or know that the main cause of severe hypogonadism in young men is previous AAS use. (Crosnoe-Shipley et al, 2015)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A database study of 6,033 men of varying ages who sought treatment for hypogonadism from 2005 to 2010 found that prior anabolic steroid use is common in young men  who  seek  treatment  for  hypogonadism,  with hypogonadal men younger than 50 years more than 10 times more likely to have prior AAS exposure than men 50 years  or  older.  Further,  in  men  with  profound hypogonadism, AAS use was the most common etiology. (Coward, et al 2015.) Inasmuch as neither the role of AAS in hypogonadism nor the issue of AAS use generally been discussed  adequately  in  mainstream  medicine,  such findings make it clear that we need to refocus the approach to evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism which has heretofore been focused on aging men, by recognizing ASIH as a unique form of hypogonadism affecting increasing numbers of young men.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark112">The Medical Profession: New Directions in ASIH</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In the most recent Endocrine Society Guidelines (2010) formulated to provide evidence based decision-making assistance to clinicians treating hypogonadism, AAS or ASIH were not mentioned in either the text, references, nor illustrative tables. However, in 2013, an Endocrine Society Expert  Panel was convened, presumably to address this deficit, in the face of what one member has called  a  &quot;cultural  tsunami  at  the  corner  gym&quot;  and increasing reports of AAS use with adverse events. (Canavan, 2013) The final report issues a call for physicians to  become  better  informed  about  AAS  and  related conditions like ASIH, to understand and respond to the motivations of users in a non-judgmental way, and to study the mechanisms of action of AAS.

That is, one which is informed by the distinct characteristics of this unique form of hypogonadism. Brower (2009) has provided an operational definition for diagnosis of ASIH: &quot;To confirm the physiological basis of dependence (on AAS), just ask the patient how he feels when  he  stops  use.&quot;  This  physiologically  based &quot;withdrawal  syndrome&quot;  is  characterized  primarily  by sexual dysfunction,e.g. poor libido and ED, and depressed mood-the  &quot;hallmarks&quot;  of  HPT  shutdown.  (Kaskin  &amp; Kleben, 1989; Hochberg et al, 2009; Tan &amp; Scally, 2009; Brower, 2009; Rhanema et al, 2014)</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Thus, when these symptoms are present in a confirmed past or current AAS user, a diagnosis of ASIH can be made with confidence.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Regarding the physical exam for hypogonadism, Salenave et al (2012) have reported that this exam is &quot;usually normal if hypogonadism is of recent onset. Diminished facial, body hair and muscle mass, fine facial wrinkles, gynecomastia, and hypotrophic testes are observed in long-standing and complete AHH.&quot; Rhanema et al (2014) state that these symptoms should be noted &quot;if observed&quot; Obviously, if observed in addition to the hallmark ASIH symptoms,  these symptoms  should also be treated. However, the absence of these additional side effects, which vary with length of AAS use and completeness of testicular shutdown, should neither discourage nor delay an initial diagnosis of ASIH. Acknowledgement of AAS use, and what have been described by experts as its hallmark symptoms of sexual and mood dysregulation, have been well documented.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  benefit  of  this  disease-specific  approach  to diagnosing ASIH is two-fold: First, it would promote immediate medical intervention to relieve suffering and its  potentially  harmful  sequellae  which  can  include depression severe enough to trigger resumption of use or even suicidality. (Brower, 2009). Secondly, it would support the  timely  intervention  needed  to  limit  continuing damage  to  the  HPT  system  as  patients  undergo withdrawal, and to begin reversal of existing damage caused  by  AAS.  To  delay  medical  intervention  by requiring lengthy, expensive and arguably superfluous diagnostic  procedures  which  would  not  change  a physician&#39;s treatment decision in any case, risks what has been characterized as &quot;hormonal collapse&quot; (Turek, 2013).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">This has been described as anything from persistent, long­ term AAS induced hypogonadism to permanent testicular shutdown,   irreversible   (primary)   hypogonadism. (Borogowda, et al, 2001; Rhanema et al, 2014)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark116">In order to prevent this outcome of failure to treat in a timely manner, a number of experts have recommended immediate  intervention,  cautioning  that  intervention must not only be timely and symptom focused, but must also  continue  until  symptoms  indicate  adequate restoration of HPT. (Brower, 2009; Hochberg, 2003; Rahnema et al, 2014)</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Role ol Labs in Diagnosis and Treatment</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is important to recognize that patients who may still be using, or have recently used AAS will have testosterone levels, which are not valid indicators for clinical decision making, as these will be predictably high. Requiring patients  to  wait  until  their  current  high  levels  of testosterone fell to hypogonadal levels, per labs, before treating them, would cause them needless suffering, since years of being on supraphysiologic testosterone, whether prescribed or self-administered (i.e., illegal), predictably results in hypogonadism when these are removed. (Jarow &amp; Lipschultz, 1990; Kanayama et al, 2009; Brower, 2009;</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Talih et al, 2007; Spratt, 2012; Hochberg, 2003). Clearly, requiring patients to go this &quot;cold turkey&quot; route can not only cause unnecessary suffering, but can also be physiologically harmful and psychologically dangerous, as indicated earlier.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A &quot;more rational approach&quot; recommended by a number of experts,  is  immediate  substitution  of  physiological testosterone to relieve symptoms and support cessation, tapering the dose as HPT function is restored, and/or provision  of  medications  to  relieve  symptoms,  e.g., gynecomastia (tamoxifen), restore fertility (hCG), and encourage restoration of HPT, with the understanding that these medications warrant continuation for as long as they are required. That is, until symptoms indicate adequate restoration of HPT. (Zitzmann &amp; Nieschlag, 2000; Hochberg et al, 2003; Talih et al, 2007; Spratt, 2012; Rahnema et al, 2014).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">While lab values may not be valid or reliable diagnostic indicators  of  AAS  related  hypogonadism,  they  are, however, important guides for subsequent treatment. For example,  after  treatment  has  begun,  persistence  of symptoms, despite &quot;normal&quot; testosterone levels, could indicate  inadequate  medications/doses,  or  severely</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">damaged HPT, requiring adjustments in the treatment. Too high lab values during treatment can indicate either use of illegal steroids and ancillary drugs, or too-early lab draws when patients do not understand the importance of  timely  draws,  indicating  the  need  for  patient counseling.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In summary, in addition to individualizing the treatment of  hypogonadism,  which  is  already  a  complex</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">undertaking (Morgentaler et al, 2012), it is important for clinicians to recognize the need to tailor diagnosis and treatment  of  ASIH  which,  because  of  its  unique pharmacodynamics,   presents   predictably   unique challenges. Hopefully, the foregoing discussion of the current ASIH literature can provide some guidelines to help clinicians adapt their diagnosis and treatment of this condition, which is considered one of the most intractable of all substance abuse.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark117">References: Diagnosing ASIH</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s57" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: left;">Borogowda, K et al. &quot;Persistent primary hypogonadism associated with anabolic steroid abuse&quot;

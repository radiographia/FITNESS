This agent is not sold for human use anywhere in the world at this time, but is readily available as an industrial chemical. Among other things, it is used as an intermediary for the production of certain dyes, <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>photographic  development,  as  <span style=" color: #393939;">a  </span>fungicide,  in  wood pressure-treatment  to  prevent  rotting,  and  as  an insecticide. It is technically classified as a poison. Although quite   incongruous   with   this   list   of   strong industrial/chemical uses,this chemical was sold during the era of patent medicine as a diet drug for humans. It is this property of dinitrophenol that remains of interest to some bodybuilders today.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Dinitrophenol induces weight loss by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation,  thereby  markedly  increasing  the metabolic rate and body temperature . While this <span style=" color: #393939;">is </span>an extremely effective way of producing rapid weight loss, there seems to be no ceiling to DNP&#39;s temperature increasing effect. Herein lies perhaps its most dangerous trait; it may allow body temperature to rise to level that can be damaging, even fatal. Writer Carl Malmberg made perhaps one ofthe earliest and most famous quotes about this danger back in the 1930s when he told of <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>physician who was &quot;literally cooked to death&quot; from using it.This was far from an isolated case, and deaths associated with DNP have continued over the decades. For example, a recent highly publicized story concerns a man that died on Long Island, NY in 2001 after taking DNP for only four days. The dose used was reported to be 600 mg per day, just <span style=" color: #393939;">three </span>200 mg capsules.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1811">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The fat-loss properties of DNP were reportedly first noticed during World War I, when overweight men working with DNP  in  munitions  plants  started  losing  substantial amounts of weight. It did not take very long for this chemical to be identified as the cause. Soon after, it was packaged as a drug product. By 1935, more than 100,000 Americans had already used &quot;patent medicine&quot; remedies that included DNP. In fact, DNP was the first synthetic drug that was ever used for weight reduction in this country. While it was available, it was being widely advertised as a new, safe, and effective way to get thin. Popular <span style=" color: #393939;">brand </span>names for DNP included Dinitriso, Nitromet, Dinitrenal and Alpha Dinitrophenol. At the peak of DNP&#39;s popularity, <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>drug could be found in pharmacies all across the country.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While the drug may have worked for the intended purpose, it was also introduced <span style=" color: #393939;">at a </span>time before government review</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">and approval of drug safety. In this regard DNP had some very strong shortcomings, and it didn&#39;t take long for reports of side effects to began pouring in. One such incident involved a dozen women in California who were temporarily blinded by the drug. Numerous reports of DNP-linked cataracts began coming in from as far away as France and Italy. It was said to be happening with doses as little as 100 mg daily when taken for long periods. Reports of more serious injury, even death, from DNP use followed. With such highly unfavorable safety reports, the drug was soon pulled. By 1938 it was off the market for good. It has never returned as a medicine for human or animal consumption. Even so, reports of death associated with DNP use continue to this day.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1812">Author&#39;s Note: </a><span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>was hesitant to even include a profile of dinitrophenol in this book, for fear it might entice someone who otherwise may not have known about it to use it. But ultimately I decided it would be better to include the historical information about the drug. The true story of DNP is a scary one and needs to be remembered. Bodybuilders must understand that the reemergence of underground  DNP  in  the  late  1990s  was  not  a revolutionary new achievement in fat loss, but a scary repitition of one of the biggest mistakes of the patent medicine era. It is a drug from a time when an unregulated market was allowing dangerous chemicals like this to harm the public.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exists today to protect the public from such scenarios. Almost all experts today agree that DNP is a dangerous drug, and is not recommended for weight loss.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1813">DNP is not supplied in a form prepared for human or veterinary consumption. It is available as a research or industrial chemical only.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">DNP (2,4-Dinitrophenol) is a cellular metabolic poison with the chemical designation 1-hydroxy-2,4-dinitrobenzene.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1814">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1815">There are many potential side effects associated with DNP use including increased heart rate, increased breathing rate,  nausea,  elevated  body  temperature,  insomnia, profuse sweating, rash, skin lesions, decreased white blood cell count, cataracts, coma, and death.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1816">DNP is not approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable. A common dose used among bodybuilders is reportedly 2mg per kg of bodyweight per day. This calculates to a dosage of 200 mg per day for a person of approximately 220 pounds of bodyweight. Note that this population tends to retain more lean muscle mass than the average (sedentary) person of the same bodyweight, which may substantially alter the results and side effects of a given dosage. Admittedly, fat loss due to DNP use is highly rapid and extreme, with some people losing as much as .5 to 1 pound of fat weight per day.This can equate to a drop of 15 or 20 pounds in only a few weeks. Given the high risks associated with DNP use, however, it is usually taken for only a few weeks at a time. The strong incidence of side effects is also regarded as an indicator  that  the  drug  should  be  discontinued immediately. Note that most experts regard DNP as a drug with inherent dangers that far outweigh its potential benefits.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">DNP is not available as a human or veterinary medication in any part of the world. Availability of products intended for human use is entirely in the underground realm, where products, dosages, and safety are not the subject of government approval.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lipostabil N (phosphatidylcholine/sodium deoxycholate)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1817">Description:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipostabil N is an injectable medication that contains phosphatidylcholine (PPC), a natural phospholipid. Sodium deoxycholate (a bile salt) is also added (among other ingredients) to solubilize PPC in water. It was originally developed as an intravenous solution for the improvement of serum lipids, reduction of arterial plaque, improving liver values, and the prevention or treatment of blood vessel blockages by fat particles (fat embolism). It is approved as an intravenous drug in a number of countries, mainly in Europe. Lipostabil has also had a very popular off-label use over the past several years, namely as a localized fat loss agent. Clinics in many areas of the world including Brazil, Europe, and the United States have actually marketed this as a nonsurgical alternative to liposuction. In recent years, bodybuilders have been paying some attention to this drug as well, using it as a cutting or finishing agent.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1818">The  mechanism  behind  Lipostabil&#39;s  lipolytic  (fat  loss promoting) effect is unique. Upon injection, the solution acts as a detergent, causing nonspecific lysis (breakdown) of cell membranes.</a><span class="s33">1 </span>The bile salt sodium deoxycholate is actually believed to play an important role here, and is therefore considered an active constituent of Lipostabil for the context of this profile (it is normally considered an inactive ingredient). During this process the fatty acids stored in the cell membrane are released, which includes arachidonic  acid.  This  will  trigger  the  inflammatory cascade, benefiting lipolysis (the inflammatory system can be a powerful remodeler of body composition) but also causing    unwelcome    pain    and    swelling. Phosphatidylcholine itself also triggers the release of lipases used in the removal of fat.<span class="s33">2 </span>All of this works together to dismantle localized fat stores, which are removed via the liver in the form of gall acids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipostabil first appeared as a medication during <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>1950s. Although not approved for prescription use in the U.S., it is approved for medical use in a number of other countries. The  most  popular  brand  name  is  Lipostabil  <span style=" color: #393939;">N  </span>by Nattermann, although it is also found as Lipostabil Forte and simply as Lipostabil.The application of this drug for fat loss is generally viewed as an &quot;off-label&quot; use of the medication, although it undoubtedly remains a highly popular factor in its sales. Some doctors do believe that using Lipostabil for cosmetic purposes is controversial, and advise against using it for cosmetic reasons. When you look at the available data, however, its safety profile appears to be admittedly very high. Lipostabil has been widely used as an intravenous drug for more than 40 years, and has</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">displayed very few clinically significant side effects during that time. Injecting the same drug subcutaneously is not likely to present any significant new or serious risks to the patient.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1819">Network Lipolysis (an organization of some 350 doctors worldwide that supports this use of Lipostabil) reports over  18,000  cosmetic  treatments  without  unexpected adverse events. Additionally, Dr. Hasengschwandtner, the medical director of the Austrian clinic Therapy Centre Bad Loefelden, has reported on bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferases  (markers  of  liver  stress)  values  after subcutaneous Lipostabil use,</a><span class="s33">3 </span>to see if this new method of fat remodeling is causing liver strain. The results were in line with IV use, showing no abnormal change in these values. Although we do not have a great deal of data on this off-label use of Lipostabil, what can <span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>found is generally very positive, and suggests this drug (or natural drug, if you will) is quite safe. Lipostabil is presently sold in Germany, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic, Hong Kong, and South Africa</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipostabil  is  most  commonly  supplied  in  injectable ampules containing 5 mL of solution each.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1820">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">The  primary  active  ingredients  in  Lipostabil  are phosphatidylcholine           (phosphatidyl-N- trimethylethanolamine)   and   sodium   deoxycholate (cholan-24-oic acid, 3,12-dihydroxy-, monosodium salt).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1821">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Potential  side  effects  associated  with  subcutaneous Lipostabil injections include localized swelling, redness of the skin, burning, pain, tenderness, and bruising. Systemic side effects are reported in approximately 3% of users and may include diarrhea, nausea, dizziness,and intermenstrual bleeding.<span class="s33">4</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1822">Administration:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  typical  practice  for  using this drug to  promote localized fat loss involves a series of subcutaneous injections. <span style=" color: #393939;">A </span>total dosage of 1250-2500 mg is often used, which equates to 25-50 mL of injectable solution. This dosage is divided into 20 or more separate smaller injections. These are spaced throughout the problematic area (quite commonly the abdominals or thighs), and are all given during the same office visit or application period. The drug is not administered on a daily basis.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipostabil injections usually cause a significant amount of inflammation in the area, which may take a week or longer to fully subside. When the inflammation does subside, however, it usually unveils a noticeable amount of fat loss. In a clinical setting, this procedure is often repeated a few times, so as to sculpt the area and achieve the desired level of fat reduction.The current guidelines set forth by Network Lipolysis call for an 8-week break between treatment periods. When taken outside of a clinical setting, it is usually advised to apply the first course at a much lower dosage in order to judge individual sensitivity to the drug. Some find it simply too painful to use, while others seem to tolerate the whole procedure extremely <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">well.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1823">As for the ultimate question of how well it works, it is difficult to give exact numbers, as few clinical studies have been conducted on this use of the drug. The anecdotal feedback is mixed. Many people who try it report positive results, particularly for the removal of those last stubborn areas of fat interfering with muscle definition. There do not seem to be many reports of dramatic weight loss, however, nor does it seem to be the &quot;pharmaceutical liposuction&quot;that some clinics describe it to be. Regardless, the reports of visible improvements in fat loss and muscle definition are consistent and compelling enough to be given credit. For those extremely overweight, this product is not likely to perform well, but as a finishing touch it may hold value.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipostabil is not a controlled drug in the U.S. or Europe, and as such is fairly easy to obtain on the black market or via mail order drug distributors. &quot;Mesotherapy&quot; clinics selling procedures with Lipostabil are also fairly common.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 5pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s65">1 </span>Detergent <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">effects </span>of sodium deoxycholate <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">are </span>a major feature <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">of </span>an injectable phosphatidylcholine formulation used for localized <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">fat </span>dissolution.

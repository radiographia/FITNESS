Reductase inhibitors are designed to prevent the conversion  of  testosterone  to  its  more  androgenic counterpart DHT (dihydrotestosterone). DHT is implicated in a number of disorders in men including male pattern hair loss and benign prostate enlargement. Dutasteride is specifically approved for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). While dutasteride is similar in structure and action to finasteride, it differs from the  first  generation  reductase  inhibitor  in  its  tissue selectivity. Finasteride inhibits the type-2 isozyme of the 5- alpha reductase enzyme, found prominently in the scalp and prostate. Dutasteride is non-specific for isotype, and inhibits both type-1 and type-2 reductase. As such, it inhibits DHT conversion in all tissues including the scalp, liver, prostate, and skin. Because of this it also lowers systemic  levels  of  DHT  much  more  effectively  than finasteride.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The DHT inhibiting effects of dutasteride make this drug of some interest to bodybuilders and athletes, particularly those  concerned  with  the  androgenic  component  of testosterone-based  steroids.  Dutasteride  is capable of reducing the androgenic side effects produced by DHT conversion, changing the profile of testosterone drugs measurably. Provided moderate doses of testosterone are being used, the result can be a substantial reduction in the occurrence of oily skin and acne. For those prone to male pattern hair loss, dutasteride may also reduce the harsh impact of testosterone on the hairline. Note that as a selective type-2 inhibitor, finasteride is also effective at lowering DHT levels in the scalp (and reducing hairline impact of testosterone use), but does not work as well for reducing oily skin and acne.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In terms of overall potency, a study published in the <i><b>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism </b></i>(May 2004) directly   compared   dutasteride   to   its   closest pharmaceutical   counterpart,   finasteride.’   In   this investigation 399 males suffering from benign prostatic hypertrophy were assembled and separated into three general groups, each receiving dutasteride (subdivided by doses of .01, .05, .5,2.5, or 5.0 mg daily), finasteride (.5 mg daily) or placebo, for a period of 24 weeks. Over the 24- week period, the dutasteride group noted the strongest level of DHT inhibition. The beneficial effects of this drug also occurred over a wide range of dosages. For example, a 5 mg daily amount caused 98.4% inhibition in DHT levels, while 1/1 Oth of this amount (.5 mg daily, the adopted therapeutic dose) lowered levels by an average of 94.7%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This was in great contrast to the 5 mg finasteride group, which noticed only 70.8% inhibition. Researchers also noted that there was significantly more of a variation in the results of the finasteride group, with some patients noting DHT suppression in the range of only 50-55%.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2036">Just as there can be benefits to lowering 5-aipha reductase activity by way of less androgenic side effects, there can also be some drawbacks. For one, a strong androgen like DHT  helps  with  neuromuscular  interaction,  fostering strength and muscle gain. Users of reductase inhibitors often report a drop in their maximum lifts soon after the drug  is  initiated.  Libido  may  also  decline  as  DHT concentrations are lowered. A small percentage of men even find the need to keep Viagra on hand, as dutasteride renders  them  otherwise  impotent.  Dihydrotestosterone also serves as a potent endogenous anti-estrogen, as this non-aromatizable steroid competes with other substrates (like testosterone, which aromatizes) to bind with the aromatase enzyme. Gynecomastia or other estrogenic side effects  may  occur  when  this  competition  is  absent. Gynecomastia is listed in the warnings for this product, although the frequency of this in testing was very low (1.1% of users).</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2037">Dutasteride was first described in 1997.</a><span class="s50">2 </span>It was developed by  the  U.S.  based  pharmaceutical  company GlaxoSmithKline.

Reductase inhibitors lessen these side effects  by  reducing,  not  eliminating,  the  level  of androgenic activity in the skin and scalp. Androgenic and anabolic effects are both mediated by the same receptor, and there is presently no way known to completely separate these two properties. Dihydrotestosterone is also not unique in its ability to facilitate androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss). DHT inhibition, therefore, does not offer complete protection against this side effect.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Reductase  inhibitors  are  only  applicable  with testosterone,  methyltestosterone,  and  fluoxymesterone.

Reductase inhibition may</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">intensify    their    androgenic    side    effects.

This drug can efficiently reduce the serum  concentration  of DHT,  thereby minimizing  the unwanted androgenic effects that result from its presence. The effect of this drug is quite rapid, suppressing serum DHT concentrations as much as 65% within 24 hours after taking a single 1mg tablet. Medically, this drug is used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia (prostate enlargement) and androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss). It is also being investigated as a potential treatment for hirsutism, which describes male patterned hair growth on the face or body of a woman. Male athletes and bodybuilders are interested in finasteride for its ability to reduce the androgenic  side  effects  associated  with  the  use  of testosterone and certain derivatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Finasteride is a specific inhibitor of theType-ll 5a reductase enzyme. There are actually two isozymes of reductase in the human body, labeled as Type-I and Type-ll.Type-l 5a- reductase  is  predominantly  found  in  the  liver  and sebaceous glands of the skin. Type-ll 5a-reductase is primarily found in the prostate and hair follicles.The Type- ll enzyme is responsible for about 2/3rd of the circulating DHT, while the Type-1 enzyme produces the remaining 1/3rd. As an inhibitor of Type-ll reductase only, finasteride has a more pronounced effect with regard to preventing hair loss, but is somewhat less effective at mitigating oily skin and acne. Since hair loss is the primary worry among most male steroid users who use reductase inhibitors, finasteride remains a popular ancillary drug in spite of its inability to block DHT conversion in all tissues.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Finasteride is considered <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>highly specific drug, as it has little spillover effect on the other hormones in the body. It has no affinity for the androgen or estrogen receptors, and therefore  does  not  exhibit  any  androgenic,  anti- androgenic, estrogenic, or anti-estrogenic properties. It has no appreciable impact on circulating levels of cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine, nor does it appear to alter HDL/LDL cholesterol levels. Changes in luteinizing hormone (LH) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also not notable, and it is not shown to have a significant effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Finasteride has been shown to increase the circulating levels of testosterone by roughly 15%, however, since a greater amount of the androgen is being left unaltered by the reductase enzyme.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2043">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2044">The first release of finasteride in the U.S. was under the brand name of Proscar® (Merck), which was approved by the FDA in 1992.lt was specifically given approval for use by patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (prostate enlargement).

Merck released the drug under a different brand name for this purpose, Propecia®, which contained only 1/5th of the Proscar® dosage. Today, both Proscar® and Propecia® remain the dominant brands of finasteride on the global market.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Finasteride is most commonly supplied in tablets of 1 mg and 5 mg.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2045">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid.

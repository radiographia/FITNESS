It is also FDA approved for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions caused by allergens, often as an adjunct to injectable epinephrine (adrenalin). The serotonin inhibiting effect of this drug also gives it a unique ability to increase appetite. This has led to a considerable amount of off-label use as a weight-gain medication, particularly with patients who are suffering from a lean tissue wasting associated with AIDS infection, cancer, or other debilitating diseases. Cyproheptadine hydrochloride is also used on occasion as an adjunct to growth hormone therapy in children, to foster greater nutrient uptake and increases in linear growth beyond what is normally achieved with rHGH alone.<span class="s33">1 </span>Bodybuilders and athletes use the drug on occasion to help increase caloric intake, usually during periods of bulking training where increased mass is desired, and often used in conjunction with anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although this is a controversial use of the drug, references to the appetite stimulating properties of cyproheptadine hydrochloride are abundant in the medical literature. One of  the  more  detailed  papers  compares  the  appetite increasing  effects  of  cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  to megestrol acetate<span class="s33">2 </span>in a group of 14 men with weight loss associated with HIV infection.The other agent, megestrol, is a progestin that was approved by the FDA in 1993 for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or weight loss in patients with  AIDS.  In  this  investigation,  cyproheptadine hydrochloride was shown to have a similar level of benefit to  FDA  approved  agent  megestrol,  with  patients consuming about 500 extra calories per day, and gaining a moderate amount of weight with either medications. While the benefits were similar, the side effects were not. The investigators reported that more than 50% of the patients taking  megestrol  suffered  impotence  during  the investigation,  while  the  cyproheptadine  hydrochloride group  had  no  such  side  effects.  Cyproheptadine hydrochloride  may  offer  an  effective  alternative  to megestrol therapy for many patients, especially those prone to negative side effects associated with this type of hormone manipulation.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1675">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Cyproheptadine hydrochloride is an early anti-histamine drug, and has been sold as a prescription medication in most developed nations for decades. It was introduced to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">the U.S. in 1961 under the Periactin® brand name by Merck &amp; Co.This brand of cyproheptadine hydrochloride was sold for many years in the U.S, but was voluntarily discontinued by Merck in 2003 (in both the U.S. and Canada). While Merck &amp; Co. has withdrawn Periactin from a number of other nations (likely due to low financial interest), the brand is still sold in more than one dozen countries including  Australia,  Austria,  Belgium,  Ireland,  Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. It is also sold under dozens of other brand names around the world, in both single- and multi-ingredient preparations. A number of generic products are still sold in both the U.S. and Canada as well. Subsequent to studies questioning the long-term weight  gaining  value  of  cyproheptadine  hydrochloride therapy, in 1994 the World Health Organization warned against using the drug for this purpose.<span class="s33">3 </span>Regardless of this report, many still support the value of cyproheptadine hydrochloride as a short-term appetite stimulant.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1676">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1677">Cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  is  most  commonly supplied in tablets of 4 mg.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  is  antihistaminic  and antiserotonergic agent with the chemical designation 4- (5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-1-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">methylpiperidine hydrochloride sesquihydrate.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1678">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As  a  first-generation  anti-histamine,  cyproheptadine hydrochloride may be prone to producing a number of side effects in its users. The most common of which is sedation or the classic &quot;anti-histamine lethargy” which is common to these types of drugs. For some users, the tiredness that cyproheptadine hydrochloride will produce will   outweigh   any   potential   as   a   weight- gaining/performance-enhancing agent. For most, this side effect  of  cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  is  not  very</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">549</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1679">noticeable,and perhaps a nuisance (not strong enough to necessitate discontinuation) at best. Other less common side effects of concern include, but are not limited to, dizziness, disturbed coordination, muscular weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dryness of the mouth,  difficulty  urinating,  vertigo,  blurred  vision, tightness of the chest, wheezing, stuffed nose, sweating, early  period,  headaches,  and  faintness.  Any  strong incidence of unwelcome side effects would immediately warrant  discontinuing  the  drug,  or  even  seeking immediate medical attention if severe.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The dosage required for medical purposes may vary depending on the individual and their particular needs. The established therapeutic range for cyproheptadine hydrochloride is 4mg to 20 mg per day, with most adults requiring 12mg to 16mg daily. The total daily dosage is usually divided into three separate applications. When used (off-label) as an appetite stimulant, a dosage of 4mg is commonly taken 2-3 times per day (8-12mg). Above this level, side effects may become more noticeable (most notably sleepiness), often interfering with the benefit of the drug.This may be used during a steroid cycle focused on  bulking,  with  the  intake  of  cyproheptadine hydrochloride usually lasting no more than 4-8 weeks. For those  who  tolerate  this  anti-histamine&#39;s  side  effects (mainly tiredness), cyproheptadine hydrochloride is often reported to offer significant value as an appetite stimulant during weight gaining cycles. This is especially so in individuals that have trouble eating enough food to meet the high calorie/protein requirements for optimal muscle growth.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1680">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyproheptadine hydrochloride is produced <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>a wide number of countries. Although it is not commonly traded on the black market, high supply and the relatively benign nature of this drug (loose controls) make it easily diverted for  sale  when  needed.  Given  its  low  demand, counterfeiting   of   cyproheptadine   hydrochloride preparations is not common.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is interesting to also note that the Dominican steroid product,  Anabolex,  actually  includes  1.5  mg  <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  in  each  3  mg methandrostenolone  tablet,  which  was  added  by  its developers  to  facilitate  increased  caloric  intake  and weight  gain  during  anabolic  therapy.  The  2:1  ratio provided is optimal for a daily dose of 24 mg Dianabol (a very common amount), as it would provide 12 mg of cyproheptadine  hydrochloride  (the  maximum  common daily dose).

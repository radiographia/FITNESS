It specially consists of the L- isomer of the natural thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3).Thyroid hormones stimulate basal metabolic rate, and are  involved  with  many  cellular  functions  including protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Liothyronine sodium is used medically to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is usually diagnosed with a serum hormone profile (T3, T4, &amp; TSH),and may manifest itself with symptoms including loss of energy, lethargy, weight gain, hair loss, and changes in skin texture. T3 is the most active thyroid hormone in the body, and consequently liothyronine sodium is considered to be a more potent thyroid medication than levothyroxine sodium (T4).</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1795">Bodybuilders and athletes are attracted to liothyronine sodium for its ability to increase metabolism and support the breakdown of body fat. Most often utilized during contest preparation or periods of &quot;cutting&quot; the drug is usually said to significantly aid in the loss of fat, often on higher levels of caloric intake than would normally be permissive of such fat loss. To this end, the drug is also commonly used in conjunction with other fat loss agents such as human growth hormone or beta agonists. Some users also ascribe an ability of thyroid hormones like liothyronine sodium to increase the anabolic effect of steroids. While in theory these drugs may support the greater utilization </a><i><b>of </b></i>protein and carbohydrates for muscle growth, they are not widely proven or accepted for this purpose.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first medication that included T3 was technically a thyroid extract, first given to a patient with myxedema (a skin disorder associated with hypothyroidism) in 1891.<span class="s50">1 </span>Natural thyroid extracts contained therapeutically viable levels of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, and were widely used in medical practice for more than 60 years.

In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.&quot;</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1799">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Side effects are generally associated with overdosage,and may include headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, irregular heartbeat, increased bowel motility, or menstrual irregularities. Overdosage may also induce shock, and may aggravate or trigger angina or congestive heart failure. Chronic overexposure to liothyronine sodium will produce symptoms normally associated with hyperthyroidism or the overproduction of natural thyroid hormones in the body.The occurrence of overexposure-linked side effects is normally cause to immediately reduce or discontinue therapy with liothyronine sodium. Acute massive overdose may be life threatening.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1800">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used to treat mild hypothyroidism, the typical recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg daily. The daily dosage then may be increased by no more than 25 mcg every <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>to 2 weeks. The established maintenance dose is usually 25-75 mcg per day. Once a day administration of the full daily dose is usually recommended. Although liothyronine sodium is fast acting, its effects may persist in the body for several days after discontinuance.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The usual protocol among bodybuilders and athletes taking liothyronine sodium to accelerate fat loss involves initiating its use with a dosage of 25 mcg per day. This dosage may be increased by 25 mcg every 4 to 7 days, usually reaching a maximum of no more than 75 mcg <span style=" color: #393939;">per </span>day. As in a medical setting, the intent of this slow buildup is to help the body become adjust to the increasing thyroid hormone levels, and avoid sudden changes that may initiate side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Cycles of liothyronine sodium usually last no longer than</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">6 weeks, and administration of the drug should not be halted abruptly. Instead, it is discontinued in the same slow manner in which it was initiated.This usually entails reducing the dosage by 25 mcg every 4 to 7 days. This tapering is done so that the body has time to readjust its endogenous hormone production at the conclusion of therapy, and to avoid the onset of side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1801">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Liothyronine is an old and widely prescribed medication.

Thyroid hormones are primarily responsible for regulating the body&#39;s metabolic rate, and play a vital role in the body&#39;s utilization of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Levothyroxine sodium is used medically to treat cases of hypothyroidism,  which  is  characterized  by  insufficient natural production of thyroid hormones.This may manifest itself with a number of symptoms including loss of energy, lethargy, weight gain, hair loss, and changes in skin texture. Levothyroxine  sodium  is  considered  a  slow-acting medication, and may take up to 4 to 6 weeks before full therapeutic levels are reached in the blood. It is also the most  commonly  prescribed  thyroid  medication  in  the world, and is considered to be the standard form of treatment for most cases of hypothyroidism.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The action of levothyroxine sodium is very similar to that of the popular thyroid preparation Cytomel® (liothyronine sodium).  Cytomel®  is  slightly  different  in  structure, however, being a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine  (T-3).  A  healthy  individual  with  have sufficient levels of both T-3 and T-4 thyroid hormones present in their body. T-3 is considered the primary active form of thyroid hormone, while T4 serves mainly as a reserve for T3, exerting most of its metabolic activity via conversion to T3 in peripheral tissues. T3 is regarded as having an effect that is roughly four times stronger than that of T-4 on a milligram-for-milligram basis. Likewise, Cytomel® is considered to be a more potent form of thyroid medication, both with regard to activity and side effect potential.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Levothyroxine  sodium  is  valued  by  many  drug-using athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to stimulate the metabolic rate and support the breakdown of body fat stores. It is usually taken during a period of calorie restriction (“cutting&quot;), when the individual is focused on fat loss or increasing muscle definition. It is often thought that the use of thyroid drugs can support fat loss at a higher level of caloric intake than would otherwise be possible without the drugs, adding to their perceived value among the communities. Anabolic steroids are generally used in conjunction with these hormones, and many believe that the  metabolism  boosting  effect  of  these  drugs  may produce faster gains in muscle mass. The drugs, however, have yet to be widely proven or accepted for this purpose.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1803">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Levothyroxine sodium was the first synthetic thyroid</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">medication to be sold in the U.S., and was first introduced to market in 1955 by Flint Laboratories as Synthroid. The drug has a long history of therapeutic use in the U.S. and internationally, and for decades has been the most widely prescribed medication for the treatment of hypothyroid. The  Synthroid  brand  has  historically  been  the  most successful, with figures estimating that it retained 85% of total levothyroxine  sales and $600 million  in annual revenues  (1990  estimates).  In  the  bodybuilding  and athletic communities, however, the faster acting and more powerful  drug  Cytomel  (liothyronine  sodium)  is  most popular. Since Synthroid is weaker and slower acting, athletes need to take the drug for a longer duration to achieve similar results.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The Synthroid brand itself has a long and at times controversial history.<span class="s33">1 </span>For many years after its inception by Flint Laboratories, Synthroid enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the levothyroxine sodium market. Generic medications finally began taking a large share of levothyroxine sodium sales going in to the 1980s. In response, Flint Laboratories funded a study at the University of California in 1986 which attempted to demonstrate that Synthroid had a higher therapeutic value than its generic counterparts. The study was completed in 1990, and, in fact, proved that the generic drugs had equal efficacy to Synthroid.<span class="s33">2 </span>Flint exercised a clause in its contract requiring company approval before the university could publish its study. A legal battle over its publication ensued. Even after Flint Laboratories was sold to Boots, and thereafter Boots sold to Knoll, publication of the study was vigorously opposed. It was eventually ordered into publication in 1997. A class action lawsuit followed, alleging that misconduct over the publication and marketing claims forced consumers to pay 2 to 3 times more for a brand name drug than an equivalent generic counterpart. Knoll eventually settled for $135 million.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1804">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Levothyroxine sodium is most commonly supplied in oral tablets of 25 mcg, 50 mcg, 75 mcg, 100 meh, 125 mcg, 150</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mcg, 200 mcg, and 300 mcg.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1805">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic form of T4 thyroid hormone. <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">It </span>has <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">the </span>chemical <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">designation </span>L-3,3’,5,5&#39;- tetraiodothyronine sodium salt.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1806">Warnings:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1807">FDA  </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">requires  </span>that  the  following  black  box  warning <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">accompany  prescription  liothyronine  sodium  products sold  in  the  U.S.  &quot;Thyroid  hormones,  including levothyroxine  sodium,  either  alone  </span>or  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">with  other </span>therapeutic agents, should not be used for the treatment <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">of obesity or for weight loss.

These drugs belong to a class of medicines known as psoralens, which are used along with ultra violet (UV) light exposure to treat certain disorders of the skin such as vitiligo (where skin pigment  is  lost)  and  psoriasis  (a  skin  condition characterized by red and scaly blotches). Although the exact  underlying  mechanism  behind  these  agents  is unknown, they ultimately work to increase the output of melanin in response to stimulation by sunlight or artificial UV exposure. This enhances the rate of pigmentation, which in many cases will allow the lighter areas of the skin to become more evenly colored.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bodybuilders are attracted to psoralens because they may be used to help them develop that deep tan that is so favored in the world of competition and modeling. A good tan helps bring out muscle separation and definition, to the point that it is just about considered a necessity (most bodybuilders who won&#39;t tan on their own will apply an artificial brush-on tan). A natural tan usually looks much better (at least in an immediate sense), especially when you are going to be seeing people face to face.This drives many fairer skinned people to look for drugs that can help them achieve a deep bronze look that is otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve on their own. In this regard, methoxsalen seems to deliver for many people who carefully and correctly use the drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2052">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  first  successful  treatment  with  methoxsalen  was documented in 1948.&#39; By the 1950s this agent was an established medicine in many markets.

Reddening of the skin (erythema) is also common, and is an inflammatory reaction distinct from normal sunburn. Other adverse reactions  include  nausea,  nervousness,  insomnia, depression,  edema,  dizziness,  headache,  malaise, pigmentation  irregularities,  cyst,  blister,  rash,  herpes simplex, prickly heat, inflammation of the hair follicles, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin touch sensitivity, leg cramps, low blood pressure, and exacerbated psoriasis.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2057">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When  used  medically  to  control  severe  psoriasis, methoxsalen  is  administered  in  conjunction  with scheduled and controlled doses of long wave ultraviolet radiation. The dosage of methoxsalen is determined by bodyweight, and will range from 10 mg to 70 mg per application.  UV  exposure levels are  determined after</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">consideration of skin type and individual responsiveness to sun exposure.Therapy is usually initiated with drug and UV exposure commencing 2-3 times per week (clearing phase), followed by a schedule of once every 1 to 3 weeks (maintenance phase).</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2058">Methoxsalen is taken with a low fat meal or milk prior to UV exposure. Exposure is scheduled around the time of peak  photosensitivity.  Time  of  peak  photosensitivity following administration is 1.5 to 2.1 hours with rapid­ release capsules (Oxsoralen-Ultra), and 3.9 to 4.25 hours for regular methoxsalen capsules.The patient is instructed not to sunbathe 24 hours before and 48 hours after each dose of methoxsalen, and to avoid all sun exposure (even through clouds or glass) for 8 hours after each dose.The patient also must wear eyewear with full UVA protection for 24 hours following each application to protect the eyes from cataracts.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dosage (by weight)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse;margin-left:5.85pt" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:15pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">(kg)</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">(lbs)</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">(mg)</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&lt;30</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&lt;66</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">10</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30-50</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">66-110</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">20</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">51-65</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">112-143</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">66-80</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">146-176</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">40</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">81-90</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">179-198</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">50</p></td></tr><tr style="height:20pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">91-115</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">201-254</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">60</p></td></tr><tr style="height:15pt"><td style="width:53pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">&gt;115</p></td><td style="width:75pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">&gt;254</p></td><td style="width:40pt"><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">70</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used (off-label) for cosmetic (tanning) purposes, the drug is usually initiated at a low dosage (10 mg), which will be slowly worked upwards by no more than 10 mg each application. The maximum dose will never exceed the recommended medical dose for a given bodyweight. As with  medical  use,  UV  light  exposure  is  scheduled approximately 2 to 4 hours after administration of regular capsules, or 1.5 to 2 hours for rapid release capsules.The amount of time spent exposed to UV light (usually a normal tanning bed) is also increased slowly, starting with very brief intervals, as the user becomes accustomed to the drug. In an effort to have better control over skin tone and reduce the likelihood of burns or injury, each application period is typically separated by several days or more of drug abstinence.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2059">Availability:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methoxsalen is available in more than 30 countries.

Melanin is formed by an enzyme reaction, which involves the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA via the enzyme tyrosinase. Radiant energy in the form of ultraviolet light is needed to complete this process. The exact mechanism that trioxsalen uses to exert its action on melanin is not clear. Some investigators feel that this drug has a direct impact on the epidermis, or more specifically the melanocytes. Others feel its action is an inflammatory one, and that the process of increased melanogenesis is only a secondary effect. Regardless of the exact mechanism, trioxsalen is widely regarded as an effective mediator of skin pigmentation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Trioxsalen is used medically to treat conditions associated with pigmentation dysfunction.The most known of these disorders is vitiligo, a condition that involves a marked loss of skin pigmentation {often in a very blotchy and uneven appearance).  Treatment  usually  involves  several consecutive months of regular trioxsalen use combined with UV light exposure. This is undertaken in an effort to slowly and safely rebuild the skin&#39;s appearance. In many instances  periodic  treatment  (maintenance)  will  be required indefinitely to control the disease.Trioxsalen has also been used to increase a patient&#39;s tolerance to sunlight, which is accomplished by the increased retention of melanin in the skin. At one time this drug was regularly prescribed to fair skinned people to reduce the likelihood of sunburn, however, due to the potential for adverse reactions the drug is no longer widely used for this purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Competitive bodybuilders often regard trioxsalen as an extremely useful finishing tool when readying for a stage appearance. It is no secret that a dark tan is considered important to the bodybuilding physique. Muscle features seem to be markedly improved with tanning, resulting in a more  &quot;ripped&quot;  and  impressive  look  on  stage.  Many bodybuilders,  especially  fair  skinned  individuals,  have trouble developing a very dark skin base. Although the use of various skin dyes (sun-less tanning products) may be popular, a tanning agent like trioxsalen is also a very common choice. While both may be valid methods for completing  a  competition  physique,  many  individuals regard the process of using trioxsalen, which produces actual pigmentation changes in the skin, as being more desirable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2061">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Trioxsalen was developed after methoxsalen, and first became an established a medicine in the U.S. during the 1960s. It has been most notably associated with ICN Pharmaceuticals, who sold the drug under the Trisoralen brand name for many years (the company has since changed its name to Valeant Pharmaceuticals). Trisoralen was FDA approved for the repigmentation of idiopathic vitiligo,  for  increasing  tolerance  to  sunlight,  and  for enhancing  pigmentation.  In  some  instances  the  drug would be prescribed to fair skin people before sun exposure (such as a tropical vacation or summer beach excursions). This was done in an effort to increase sun tolerance and the likelihood of tanning instead of burning. Later studies demonstrated the potential for psoralens to increase skin cancer risk and cataracts, however, eventually eliminating  the  use  of  Trisoralen  for  this  purpose. Prescriptions for this drug have since been largely focused on the treatment of vitiligo.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While trioxsalen remained for sale in many nations over the years, it was never able to supplant methoxsalen in the pharmaceutical market.To the contrary, trioxsalen came to be regardless as a secondary medication to the much more readily prescribed methoxsalen capsules. By 2000, Valeant Pharmaceuticals  began  discontinuing  its  Trisoralen products in almost all of its remaining markets worldwide.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">U.S.  brand  Trisoralen  tablets  were  included  in  the discontinuations, and have been unavailable for many years now.Trioxsalen tablets are still sold today, but only in a select few markets. This drug has for all intents and purposes been disregarded by Western medicine.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2062">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trioxsalen is most commonly supplied in tablets of 5 mg.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2063">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Trioxsalen is a photoactive substance belonging to a class of compounds known as psoralens.

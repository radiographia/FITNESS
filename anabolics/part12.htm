They learned long ago that you can tell a great deal about a bill this way. You can tell how and when it was printed, sometimes even where. Now we are not going to analyze the inks on steroid boxes in the lab as the Secret Service does. We will, however, look at  the  printing  closely  enough  that  it  can  help differentiate real from fake in some cases.Once again, this will be done with a handheld microscope, preferably at 200X magnification.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">First, let&#39;s go over some general information so you know what we are looking at. For this examination we intend to find out how the printing was placed on the box or label. Color  printing  is  usually  accomplished  through  two methods.The first is called &quot;process color,&quot;and the second &quot;spot color.&quot; One method may be used to print the product, or both methods may be combined on the same packaging. Each method offers its own set of advantages. When we know how and when these methods are typically applied, we can gain some insight into the thoughts of the designer. More importantly, we might be able to tell if the methods are appropriate for the product in question.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The  process  color  method  is  most  often  used  to reproduce photographs, or to print multiple colors (three or more) on one piece. It is the more flexible and visually deep method of coloring. Process color can give the appearance of hundreds, thousands, even millions of colors at one time, although technically this is an illusion. Upon microscopic examination, you will see that the colors all break down into a mix of only four separate inks: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK). The four CMYK colors are applied in tiny dots, which are assembled in different patterns.They blend together to the naked eye, giving the appearance of more colors.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part11.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part13.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

In order to fully grasp how anabolic steroids work, it is, therefore, important to understand the basic functioning of testosterone.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone, it is manufactured by the Leydig&#39;s cells in the testes at varying amounts throughout a person&#39;s life span. The effects of this hormone become most evident during the time of puberty, when an increased output of testosterone will elicit dramatic physiological changes in the male body. This includes the onset of secondary male characteristics such as a deepened voice, body and facial hair growth, increased  oil  output  by  the  sebaceous  glands, development of sexual organs, maturation of sperm, and an increased libido. Indeed the male reproductive system will not function properly if testosterone levels are not significant.  All  such  effects  are  considered  the masculinizing or &quot;androgenic&quot; properties of this hormone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Increased testosterone production will also cause growth promoting or&quot;anabolic”changes in the body, including an enhanced rate of protein synthesis (leading to muscle accumulation). Testosterone is the reason males carry more muscle mass than women, as the two sexes have vastly  contrasting  amounts  of  this  hormone.  More specifically,  the  adult  male  body  will  manufacture between 2.5 and 11 mg per day’ while females only produce about 1/4mg. The dominant sex hormone for women is estrogen, which has a significantly different effect on the body. Among other things, a lower androgen and higher estrogen level will cause women to store more body fat, accumulate less muscle tissue, have a shorter stature, and become more apt to bone weakening with age (osteoporosis).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The actual mechanism in which testosterone elicits these changes is somewhat complex. When free in the biood stream, the testosterone molecule is available to interact with various cells in the body. This includes skeletal muscle cells, as well as skin, scalp, kidney, bone, central nervous system, and prostate tissues. Testosterone binds with a cellular target in order to exert its activity, and will, therefore, effect only those body cells that posses the proper hormone receptor site (specifically the androgen receptor). This process can be likened to a lock and key system, with each receptor (lock) only being activated by a particular type of hormone (key). During this interaction,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">the testosterone molecule will become bound to the intracellular receptor site (located in the cytosol, not on the  membrane  surface),  forming  a  new  &quot;receptor complex.&quot; This complex (hormone + receptor site) will then migrate to the cell&#39;s nucleus, where it will attach to a specific section of the cell&#39;s DNA, referred to as the hormone  response  element.  This  will  activate  the transcription of specific genes, which in the case of a skeletal muscle cell will ultimately cause (among other things) an increase in the synthesis of the two primary contractile proteins, actin and myosin (muscular growth). Carbohydrate storage in muscle tissue may be increased due to androgen action as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Once this messaging process is completed, the complex will be released, and the receptor and hormone will disassociate. Both are then free to migrate back into the cytosol for further activity. The testosterone molecule is also free to diffuse back into circulation to interact with other cells. The entire receptor cycle, including hormone binding,  receptor-hormone  complex  migration,  gene transcription and subsequent return to cytosol is a slow process, taking hours, not minutes, to complete. For example, in studies using a single injection of nandrolone, it is measured to be 4 to 6 hours before free androgen receptors migrate back to the cytosol after activation. It is also suggested that this cycle includes the splitting and formation of new androgen receptors once returned to cytosol, a possible explanation for the many observations that androgens are integral in the formation of their own receptor sites.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In  the  kidneys,  this  same  process  works  to  allow androgens to augment erythropoiesis (red blood cell production).<span class="s33">3 </span>It is this effect that leads to an increase in red blood cell concentrations, and possibly increased oxygen  transport  capacity,  during  anabolic/androgenic steroid therapy. Many athletes mistakenly assume that oxymethoIone and boldenone are unique in this ability, due to specific uses or mentions of this effect in drug literature. In fact, stimulation of erythropoiesis occurs with nearly all anabolic/androgenic steroids, as this effect is simply tied with activation of the androgen receptor in kidney  cells.  The  only  real  exceptions  might  be compounds such as dihydrotestosterone and some of its derivatives,<span class="s33">4  </span>which  are  rapidly  broken  down  upon interaction    with    the    3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes (kidney tissue has a similar enzyme   distribution   to   muscle   tissue,   see &quot;anabolic/androgenic dissociation&quot; section), and therefore</p><p style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="428" height="249" alt="image" src="img/Image_002.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">CELLULAR DIAGRAM:Testosterone freely diffuses through the plasma membrane and binds with an intracellular androgen receptor.The hormone-receptor complex then enters the cell nucleus to bind with a specific segment of DNA (the Hormone Response Element), activating the transcription of specific genes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">display low activity in these tissues.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Adipose (fat) tissues are also androgen responsive, and here these hormones support the lipolytic (fat mobilizing) capacity of cells.<span class="s33">5  </span>This may be accomplished by an androgen-tied  regulation  of  beta-adrenergic  receptor concentrations  or  general  cellular  activity  (through adenylate cyclase).<span class="s33">6  </span>We also note that the level of androgens in the body will closely correlate (inversely) with the level of stored body fat. As the level of androgenic hormones drops, typically the deposition of body fat will increase.<span class="s33">7 </span>Likewise as we enhance the androgen level, body fat may be depleted at a more active rate. The ratio of androgen to estrogen action is in fact most important, as estrogen plays a counter role by acting to increase the storage of body fat in many sites of action.<span class="s33">8 </span>Likewise, if one wished to lose fat during steroid use, estrogen levels should be kept low. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that non-aromatizing steroids have always been favored by bodybuilders looking to increase the look of definition and muscularity while aromatizing compounds are typically relegated to bulking phases of training due to their tendency to increase body fat storage. Aromatization is discussed in more detail in a following section (see: Estrogen Aromatization),</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As  mentioned,  testosterone  also  elicits  androgenic activity, which occurs by its activating receptors in what are considered to be androgen responsive tissues (often through  prior  conversion to dihydrotestosterone.  See: DHT Conversion). This includes the sebaceous glands, which are responsible for the secretion of oils in the skin. As the androgen level rises, so does the release of oils. As oil output increases, so does the chance for pores becoming clogged (we can see why acne is such a common side effect of steroid use). The production of body and facial hair is also linked to androgen receptor activation in skin and scalp tissues. This becomes most noticeable as boys mature into puberty, a period when testosterone levels rise rapidly, and androgen activity begins to stimulate the growth of hair on the body and face. Some time later in life, and with the contribution of a genetic predisposition, androgen activity in the scalp may also help to initiate male-pattern hair loss. It is a misconception that dihydrotestosterone is an isolated culprit in the promotion of hair loss, however; as in actuality it is the general activation of the androgen receptor that is to blame (see: DHT Conversion). The functioning of sex glands and libido are also tied to the activity of androgens, as are numerous other regions of the central nervous/neuromuscular system.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Direct and Indirect Anabolic Effects</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although testosterone has been isolated, synthesized, and actively experimented with for many decades now, there is still some debate today as to exactly how steroids affect muscle mass. At this point in time, the primary mode of anabolic action with all anabolic/androgenic steroids is understood  to  be  direct  activation  of  the  cellular androgen receptor and increases in protein synthesis. As follows, if we are able to increase our androgen level from an external source by supplementing testosterone or a similar anabolic steroid, we can greatly enhance the rate in which protein is retained by the muscles.This is clearly the primary  cause  for  muscle  growth  with  all anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  As  our  hormone  levels increase, so does androgen receptor activation, and ultimately the rate of protein synthesis.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">But  other  indirect  mechanisms could possibly  affect muscle  growth  outside  of  the  normally  understood androgen  action  on  protein  synthesis.  An  indirect mechanism is one that is not brought about by activation of the androgen receptor, but the affect androgens might have on other hormones, or even the release of locally acting  hormones  or  growth  promoters  inside  cells (perhaps mediated by other membrane bound receptors). We must remember also that muscle mass disposition involves not only protein synthesis, but also other factors such as tissue nutrient transport and protein breakdown. We need to look at androgenic interaction with these factors as well to get a complete picture. Concerning the first possibility, we note that studies with testosterone suggest that this hormone does not increase tissue amino acid transport.<span class="s33">9 </span>This fact probably explains the profound synergy bodybuilders have noted in recent years with insulin, a hormone that strongly increases transport of nutrients  into  muscle  cells.  But  regarding  protein breakdown, we do see a second important pathway in which androgens might affect muscle growth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark4">Anti-Glucocorticoid Effect of Testosterone</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone   (and   synthetic   anabolic/androgenic steroids) may help to increase mass and strength by having  an  anti-catabolic  effect  on  muscle  cells. Considered  one  of  the  most  important  indirect mechanisms of androgen action, these hormones are shown to affect the actions of another type of steroid hormone in the body, glucocorticoids (cortisol is the primary representative of this group).<span class="s33">10  </span>Glucocorticoid hormones actually have the exact opposite effect on the muscle cell than androgens, namely sending an order to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">release stored protein. This process is referred to as catabolism, and represents a breaking down of muscle tissue. Muscle growth is achieved when the anabolic effects of testosterone are more pronounced overall than the degenerative effects of cortisol. With intense training and a proper diet, the body will typically store more protein than it removes, but this underlying battle is always constant.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5">When administering anabolic steroids, however, a much higher androgen level can place glucocorticoids at a notable disadvantage. With their effect reduced, fewer cells will be given a message to release protein, and more will be accumulated in the long run. The primarily mechanism believed to bring this effect out is androgen displacement  of  glucocorticoids  bound  to  the glucocorticoid  receptor.  In fact,  in-vitro  studies  have supported this notion by demonstrating that testosterone has a very high affinity for this receptor,</a><span class="s33">11 </span>and further suggesting that some of its anabolic activity is directly mediated through this action.<span class="s33">12 </span>It is also suggested that androgens may indirectly interfere with DNA binding to the  glucocorticoid  response  element.<span class="s33">13  </span>Although  the exact underlying mechanism is still in debate, what is clear is that steroid administration inhibits protein breakdown, even in the fasted state, which seems clearly indicative of an anti-catabolic effect.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Testosterone and Creatine</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In addition to protein synthesis, a rise in androgen levels should also enhance the synthesis of creatine in skeletal muscle tissues.<span class="s33">14 </span>Creatine, as creatine phosphate (CP), plays a crucial role in the manufacture of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is a main store of energy for the muscles. As the muscle cells are stimulated to contract, ATP molecules are broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate), which releases energy. The cells will then undergo a process using creatine phosphate to rapidly restore ADP to its original structure, in order to replenish ATP concentrations. During periods of intense activity, however,  this  process  will  not  be  fast  enough  to compensate and ATP levels will become lowered.This will cause the muscles to become fatigued and less able to effort a strenuous contraction. With increased levels of CP available to the cells, ATP is replenished at an enhanced rate and the muscle is both stronger and more enduring. This effect will account for some portion of the early strength increases seen during steroid therapy.

To be more specific, studies note a clear link between androgens and tissue release of,<span class="s33">15 </span>and responsiveness to, this anabolic hormone. For example, it has been demonstrated that increases in IGF-1 receptor concentrations in skeletal muscle  are  noted  when  elderly  men  are  given replacement doses of testosterone.<span class="s33">16 </span>In essence, the cells are becoming  primed for the actions of IGF-1, by testosterone. Alternately we see marked decreases in IGF-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">1 receptor protein levels with androgen deficiency in young men. It also appears that androgens are necessary for the local production and function of IGF-1 in skeletal muscle cells, independent of circulating growth hormone, and IGF-1 levels.<span class="s33">17 </span>Since we do know for certain that IGF-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark7">1 is at least a minor anabolic hormone in muscle tissue, it seems reasonable to conclude that this factor, at least at some level, is involved in the muscle growth noted with steroid therapy.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Direct and Indirect Steroids?</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In  looking  over  the  proposed  indirect  effects  of testosterone, and pondering the effectiveness of the synthetic anabolic/androgenic steroids, we must resist the temptation to believe we can categorize steroids as those which  directly,  and  those  which  indirectly,  promote muscle growth.The belief that there are two dichotomous groups or classes of steroids ignores the fact that all commercial steroids promote not only muscle growth but also androgenic effects. There is no complete separation of these traits at this time, making clear that all activate the cellular androgen receptor. <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>believe the theory behind direct and indirect steroid classifications originated when some  noted  the  low  receptor  binding  affinity  of seemingly strong anabolic steroids like oxymethoIone and methandrostenolone.<span class="s33">18 </span>If they bind poorly, yet work well, something else must be at work.This type of thinking</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="toc">&nbsp;</p><div class="toc"><a class="toc0" href="part4.htm"> ANABOLIC/ANDROGENIC STEROIDS </a></div><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part2.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part4.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>

While this is regarded as a medication in some regions, it actually contains a selection of natural vitamins and phospholipids. Likewise, in many areas, including the United States, Essentiale forte N is sold over the counter. The product specifically contains a complex of B vitamins, vitamin E, and phospholipid forms of linoleic, linolinec, and oleic acid. Essentiale forte N is used widely in Europe to treat cases of hepatic dysfunction, such as those caused by chronic infection, allergy, drug toxicity, or other disease. Essential forte N is of interest to steroid using bodybuilders and athletes for its ability to reduce the level of liver strain caused by anabolic/androgenic steroids (particularly those compounds that are c-17 alpha alkylated).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The main mechanism of action with Essential forte <span style=" color: #393939;">N </span>appears to be focused on the supply of antioxidants and building blocks necessary for the repair of damaged cells. This   product   contains   mainly   polyunsaturated phospholipids  (mostly  phosphatidylcholine),  and  a complex of B and E vitamins. Phosphatidylcholine is identified as a membrane lipid, and is a key component of the  Essential  forte  N  formula.  This  phospholipid  is important to the integrity of cells, adding both flexibility and  strength.  Phosphatidylcholine  has  long  been identified  as  an  important  supplement  for  the  liver, supporting normal hepatic fat metabolism and overall liver health. It is also believed to be an important antioxidant for liver and pancreatic wellness. The additional vitamins in the Essential forte N formula are likely included to increase the  antioxidant  and  regenerative  properties  of  the medication.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Essentiale forte N was the first product shown to mitigate the hepatotoxic effects of anabolic steroid use in a clinical study.<span class="s33">1 </span>The investigation looked at the effects of steroid abuse (with or without Essential forte N), and compared them to controls (non-steroid-using subjects). A full panel of liver enzymes was used to determine the level of relative hepatic strain. As expected, the steroid-only group noticed a significant elevation in liver enzymes that were well above the normal range. Liver enzymes were also elevated in the steroid users taking Essential forte N, however, they were similar to controls and remained within the normal range.The researchers concluded:&quot;The positive association of the abuse severity with the increased hepatic enzymes&#39; levels suggest a relationship between abused AAS and hepatic cell damage. However, when AAS were taken with [Essentiale forte N],... the hepatotoxic effect appears to be attenuated.&quot; While this one study does not assure that</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2017">steroid liver toxicity can be completely eliminated, it does lend strong support for the use of Essential forte N with hepatotoxic anabolic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2018">Essentiale forte N has been sold in Western and Eastern Europe for many years, where it is distributed by Aventis (formerly Rhone-Poulenc Rorerj.This compound has been approved for the treatment of hepatic liver steatosis and other hepatic dysfunction.

While in some countries this product is regarded as a drug, it contains all natural ingredients including capparis spinosa, terminalia arjuna, cichorium intybus, achillea millefolium, solanum nigrum, tamarix gallica, and cassia occidentalis. It is specifically  used  in  the  prevention  or  treatment  of hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,early liver cirrhosis, protein energy  malnutrition,  loss  of  appetite,  radiation  and chemotherapy-induced liver damage, as an adjunct to hepatotoxic drugs, and to support metabolism during convalescence or prolonged illness. As the first three letters of its name would suggest, overall liver health is the primary focus of this product. Bodybuilders and athletes use Liv-52 as a way to reduce the level of strain placed on the liver by hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Numerous medical studies have been conducted on Liv-52 in recent years, many of which involve its ability to protect the liver from damage by alcohol or other toxins.<span class="s33">9581 9592 </span><span class="s6">9603 9614 </span>Q<span class="s248">ne </span>investigation in particular looked at how the herbal medication affected the breakdown of alcohol in the body, showing that it notably increased its excretion, even to the point of being able to reduce next day hangover  symptoms  after  binge  drinking.<span class="s33">9625  </span>Another study investigated what underlying mechanism might be involved in Liv-52&#39;s ability to protect the liver against alcohol toxicity.

Liv-52 is manufactured by the Himalaya Drug Co. in Bombay, India, and was first introduced to the global market in 1955. Over the years it came to be a widely distributed and popular natural product. In 2002, the Swiss government actually classified Liv-52 as a pharmaceutical product, which is believed to be the first time an herbal remedy was adopted as a prescription drug in Western Europe.<span class="s33">9647 </span>Liv-52 had already been popular with steroid using bodybuilders and athletes for many years by this point, and further clinical</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">support only cemented this position.

It contains more than a dozen natural ingredients designed to help protect and detoxify the liver, and may be specifically useful during exposure  to  hepatotoxic  substances  such  as  oral anabolic/androgenic steroids. At the foundation of this formula are several clinically studied ingredients similar to those found in Liv-52 and Essentiale forte. For example, cichorium intybus, which was originally an old Turkish folk medicine, has been the subject of modern studies showing it can protect the liver from toxic substance damage. It has specifically been shown to lower liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase  and  alanine  aminotransferase)  and bilirubin levels after toxic exposure.<span class="s33">9651 </span>Arjuna is also used, and again has been shown to lower liver enzyme levels and stress  markers  following  hepatotoxic  substance administration.<span class="s33">9662 </span>Yarrow (achillea millefolium) was also included, and may help reduce hepatic inflammation and regulate  bile  secretion?<span class="s33">673  </span>Phosphatidylcholine  (a  key constituent of cellular membranes including liver cells) and a  combination  of  key  vitamins  round  out  the  Liv- 52/Essential forte-like base of the Liver Stabil formula.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Lipid Stapil expands on its foundation with four additional well-studied liver health ingredients.The most prevalent of these  are  N-acetyl  cysteine  and  L-glutathione.  Both nutrients  are  important  to  maintaining  ongoing  liver health, and may be especially useful in countering hepatic glutathione  depletion?<span class="s33">684  </span>an  effect  common  with  oral AAS toxicity?<span class="s33">695 </span>Next, milk thistle extract standardized for silymarin content is included. Silymarin contains several key flavonolignans that protect and detoxify the liver. In fact, this natural remedy is one of the most extensively studied and proven liver detoxification supplements, and in some regions is widely prescribed by physicians to treat numerous liver diseases including alcohol cirrhosis. An extensive review of more than a dozen placebo-controlled studies with the use of silymarin on patients with cirrhosis have  shown  it  to  consistently  reduce  aspartate aminotransferase levels and even liver-related mortality. <span class="s33">9706 </span>Regardless of the chosen liver support regimen, milk thistle should be included. Lastly, wasabi japonica is a rich source of 6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate (6-HITC). The nutrient 6-HITC is an inhibitor of glutathione S- transferase,  an  enzyme  that  breaks  down  hepatic glutathione?<span class="s33">717</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2029">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Liver Stabil was developed in 2008 by Molecular Nutrition (United States), The focus was specifically on designing a supplement that can help support liver health in users of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2030">hepatotoxic substances such as oral anabolic/androgenic steroids.

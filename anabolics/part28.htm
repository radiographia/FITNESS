It is most commonly prepared as a hydrochloride salt for use in tablets and capsules, although it is also supplied  in  oral  liquids,  injectable  solutions,  and transdermal  patches.  Clonidine  stimulates  alpha­ adrenoceptors in the brain, which reduces sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. This decreases the heart rate, and relaxes the blood vessels so that blood is  allowed  to  flow  more  easily.  Clonidine  is  widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure), which can have serious health implications if left untreated. Bodybuilders typically use this drug for the same purpose, namely to counter blood pressure elevations caused by anabolic/androgenic steroid use. Clonidine is also commonly prescribed for off-label purposes including the treatment of alcohol, opiate, and nicotine  addiction,  menopause  symptoms,  diabetic diarrhea and neuropathy (nerve damage), and ulcerative colitis.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clinical studies show that clonidine can also produce a significant increase in the serum growth hormone level. This occurs via stimulation of hypothalamic GHRH (Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone) release, which in turn supports  the  secretion  of  growth  hormone  from  the pituitary.<span class="s33">1 </span>Given the known anabolic properties of growth hormone, clonidine is sometimes specifically chosen by bodybuilders  (when  a  blood  pressure  medication  is needed)  because  of  its  perceived  added  metabolic benefits. Realistically, however, this drug is rarely reported to  produce  performance  or  body  composition improvements.This may be due to its effects on GH being short  lived.  Studies  suggest  that  in  many  patients, clonidine will not result in sustained increases in GH with continued daily use.<span class="s33">2 </span><span class="s50">3  </span>The prescribing literature even warns that its GH elevating properties are acute, and do not  result  in  chronic  elevations  with  long-term  use. Clonidine may be of value for blood pressure management or other off-label purposes, but at the present time it is not widely accepted as a GH stimulating drug for bodybuilders.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oral clonidine is considered a fast acting medication. Its blood pressure  lowering effects  are  typically noticed within 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion. Peak blood levels are achieved within 3-5 hours after administration, and the drug is metabolized with a half-life of approximately 12-16 hours. Given the short acting nature of the drug, clonidine is usually administered at least twice per day in order to maintain therapeutically effective blood levels. Food does not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of clonidine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The absorption of clonidine from transdermal patches may be significantly delayed in comparison to oral tablets, and may take 2-3 days before peak blood levels are achieved. Tolerance  to  the  blood  pressure  lowering  effects  of clonidine may develop over time. It may be necessary to periodically  reevaluate  the  dosage  during  prolonged therapy.  Clonidine  may  be  used  alone,  but  is  also commonly  combined  with  a  second  antihypertensive agent when a stronger blood-pressure lowering effect is required.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2009">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2010">Clonidine first appeared in clinical studies during the late 1960s,</a><span class="s33">4 </span>and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription sale in 1974.<span class="s33">5 </span>Over <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>years, its favorable safety profile and level of efficacy have allowed it to become a somewhat common first-line option for the treatment of hypertension. The most widely known trade name for clonidine is Catapres, sold in many different  countries  by  the  international  pharmaceutical manufacturer Boehringer-Ingelheim. In the United States, clonidine  products  are  also  available  through  many generic  drug  manufacturers  including  Actavis,  Bertek, Global, Mutual, Mylan, Par, Qualitest, UDL Laboratories, Unichem,and Xanodyne.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2011">Clonidine hydrochloride is most commonly supplied in oral tablets of 0.1,0.2, and 0.3 mg each.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2012">Clonidine is an alpha-agonist hypotensive agent derived from imidazoline.

Patients should not discontinue clonidine treatment without consulting their physician. When discontinuing clonidine, it is usually advised to slowly reduce the dosage over a minimum period of 2-4 days to reduce withdrawal symptoms.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2013">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2014">Common side effects associated with clonidine treatment include  dry  mouth  (40%  of  patients  during  clinical studies), drowsiness (33%), dizziness (16%), constipation (10%),  and  sedation  (10%).  Less  frequent  adverse reactions  include  physical  fatigue,  fever,  increased sensitivity to alcohol, abnormal heart beat, congestive heart failure, delirium, insomnia, nightmares, paraesthesia (tingling of the skin), hair loss, rash, abdominal pain, anorexia, hepatitis, vomiting, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, frequent waking to urinate during the </a><span style=" color: #393939;">night </span>(nocturia), leg cramps, muscle pain, blurred vision, and dryness or burning of the eyes. Some side effects appear to be dose-dependant. Taking more than the prescribed amount (overdosage)  may result in serious adverse reactions including hypotension (low blood pressure), respiratory  depression,  impaired  motor  reflexes, weakness, drowsiness, hypothermia, heart irregularities, coma, or death.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used medically to treat hypertension, the dosage must be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. The usual initial starting dosage in adults is .1 mg given twice daily, morning and evening (.2 mg per day). This dosage may be increased once per week by .1 mg/day until the proper maintenance dosage is achieved. An effective therapeutic maintenance dosage usually rests between .2 mg and .6 mg per day, although a small percentage  of  patients  require  significantly  higher amounts  (2.4  mg/day  is  considered  the  maximum therapeutic dosage). When used by bodybuilders to offset elevated  blood  pressure  due  to  anabolic/androgenic steroid  use,  therapeutic  use  guidelines  are  usually followed.  Some  users  will  initiate  clonidine  at  sub- therapeutic dosages (.1 mg per day) if they are unsure of their responsiveness to the drug, or their relative need for a hypotensive agent. Individuals should be reminded that it  is  important  to  monitor  blood  pressure  closely whenever  taking  any  medications  that  can  have hypertensive or hypotensive effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2015">Availability Trends:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Clonidine is widely sold throughout the developed world.

More specifically, it is a dihydro (5- alpha reduced) form of the anabolic steroid boldenone. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>is also structurally very similar to Primobolan (methenolone), except that 1-testosterone lacks the additional 1-methyl group used to increase steroid oral bioavailability. The activity of this steroid is that of a strong anabolic agent, with moderate androgenic properties. The standard rat assays show it to be approximately twice as anabolic as testosterone propionate, while it retains a similar level of androgenicity. This gives it an anabolic ratio of about 2, which means it is twice as anabolic as it is androgenic. 1- testosterone is one of the most potent naturally occurring steroids to be isolated, and is valued by bodybuilders for its ability to promote significant muscle tissue gains without water bloat or strong side effects.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although synthesized some years earlier, the first detailed mention  of  1-testosterone  in  the  Western  medical literature seems to come in 1962.<span class="s33">2 </span>It was favorably studied (on a limited basis), but never developed as a prescription drug product, likely for a simple lack of financial viability (there are literally thousands of testosterone analogs that have been developed over the years, but certainly no incentive to try and develop all of them into medicines). It was once placed into development as an ether derivative (1-methoxycyclohexyloxy) called mesabolone, but even this was very short lived. 1-testosterone had essentially been lost in the steroid research books for decades, and was all but forgotten.Things changed very quickly in 2002, however, when the drug was released to the U.S. market as a   nutritional   supplement.   Although   technically questionable in a legal sense, the popularity of the new hormone was rapid and extreme, and countless OTC 1- testosterone products soon followed.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1-Testosterone is not intrinsically a very orally active</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="325" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_097.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">hormone.Therefore, it is a little difficult to create a product of high potency with this method of administration. It is very much like taking a powerful hormone such as testosterone, and trying to stuff it in a capsule. The liver is too efficient at breaking steroids down for this to be effective.  When  1-testosterone  was  available  as  a supplement in the U.S., oil-solubilized softgels using 1- testosterone  tetrahydropyranyl  ether,  hexyldecanoate ester, and undecanoate ester were the most effective products.  These  products  resembled  Andriol,  which dissolves  an  ester-modified  form  of  testosterone (undecanoate) in oil to help deliver the steroid to the body via the lymphatic system (bypassing the destructive first- pass through the liver).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Some companies were also formulating this steroid in transdermal  gels  during  this  time,  which  is  another effective method of getting this hormone into your body. These products were designed in a similar fashion as Androgel, and likely delivered about 10% of the applied dose to the body systemically. Lastly, there were a few products that were made as injectables (1-testosterone cypionate), which reportedly worked very well.This would be the preferred method of using 1-testosterone, although no legitimate prescription drug preparation like this has ever  existed  (these  were  essentially  injectable  drug products created by unregulated supplement companies). While many consumers used them with great success, there was simply no government oversight assuring such products were made to pharmaceutical specifications.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1-Testosterone was sold on the sports supplement market in the U.S. for approximately three years. It was finally classified as a Class III controlled substance in January 2005, as part of an expanded Anabolic Steroid Control Act that was passed by Congress that sought to eliminate OTC steroids. These products were most often described by their  manufacturers  as  prohormones  or  prosteroids, although were in reality often just unscheduled (unknown to lawmakers) steroids.

It contains one additional double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (1-ene), which helps to stabilize the 3-keto group and increase the steroid&#39;s anabolic properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark273">Note that the name 1-testosterone is actually a misnomer, and is not a formal identification for this drug.The term 1- testosterone is more appropriately applied </a><span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>the steroid boldenone, which consists of a testosterone molecule modified with a 1-ene group. Given the widespread association of 1-testosterone with this steroid, however, it has been identified as such in this reference book.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1-Testosterone does metabolize to estrogen in the body, even though there is no evidence that the body can insert a double bond at carbon-4.<span class="s33">3 4 </span>The exact nature of this transformation is unknown. Given experiences with the hormone, 1-testoserone is considered to be only a mild estrogenic  steroid.  Estrogen-linked  side  effects  are generally  not  seen  when  administering  this  steroid, including  gynecomastia,  fat  deposition,  and  visibly increased  water  retention.  Gains  made  with  1- testosterone tend to be quality muscle mass, not the smooth bulk that often accompanies steroids highly open to aromatization. 1-Testosterone is, therefore, a steroid most favored during cutting phases of training, when water and fat retention are major concerns, and sheer mass not the central objective.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark274">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and  clitoral  enlargement.  Due  to  its  lower  relative androgenicity,  women often find  this preparation an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark275">acceptable choice provided low doses are used. Although 1-testosterone is primarily anabolic </a><span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>nature, strong androgenic side effects are possible with higher doses, and should be carefully monitored. Note that the 5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize 1-testosterone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1-Testosterone is not known to be a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity is unlikely within normal parameters of use. Note  that  studies  have  shown  that  1-testosterone significantly increases liver weight (unlike testosterone), suggesting that risk of liver toxicity cannot be completely excluded with high doses or prolonged administration.<span class="s33">5</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark276">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   Impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>-Testosterone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandrolone due to its weakly aromatized nature, but a weaker impact than most c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Due to the route of delivery, oral <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>-testosterone will have a slightly stronger negative effect on lipids compared to injections.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark277">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

The focus of this program was to develop longer-acting esters of testosterone, which improved on the disadvantages of existing esters such as enanthate and cypionate, which tended to produce short supraphysiological surges in androgen levels, followed by steadily declining and uneven androgen levels until the next point of administration. Phase-I clinical studies were completed in 1992 (described above), and supported the potential adoption of this agent for the treatment of andropause. Studies conducted three years later suggest the drug may also be useful for male contraception.<span class="s33">3 </span>Testosterone buciclate has already seen a considerable amount of study at this point, but, unlike its similarly  slow-acting cousin  Nebido®, has yet to be adopted as a prescription drug for widespread use.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark285">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark286">Testosterone buciclate is not currently available as a commercial drug product.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone buciclate is a modified form of testosterone, where a carboxylic acid ester (trans-4-n-butylcyclohexyl- carboxylate) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark287">group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms  of  testosterone  are  designed  to  prolong  the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Testosterone buciclate is designed to maintain physiological levels of testosterone for approximately 1</a><i><b>2 </b></i>weeks after injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. <span style=" color: #393939;">An </span>anti-estrogen such as domiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark288">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that both anabolic and androgenic effects are mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark289">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark290">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">4</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">5 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per  week  for  twenty  weeks  without  an  aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">%,</span><span class="s50">6 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">7  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark291">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at </a><span style=" color: #393939;">all </span>times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months after the drug has  fully  cleared  the  body.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark292">The above side effects are not inclusive.

For bodybuilding purposes, supraphysiological (rather than physiological) hormone levels would require injecting the drug on a more regular basis. The most effective use of this compound in a bodybuilding sense would probably entail the injection of two or more doses of 600 mg in the first two weeks of a cycle. After this point another full dose might be given every 7-15 days,depending on the desired potency or other steroids used. The drug could be discontinued 6-9 weeks before the cycle is going to be concluded, and may cause androgen levels to remain elevated 12 weeks or more after the last dose is given. Post-cycle  therapy  should  be  planned  accordingly. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids depending on the desired effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In the context of bodybuilding, testosterone buciclate will be an effective drug, but it is probably not going to win any awards. For one, a cycle based on this compound would be somewhat slower to start than normal, as it will take time and numerous injections for peak blood levels of testosterone to be reached. For the same reason, testosterone buciclate will end up offering its greatest value in cycles lasting more than 4 or 5 months, where its slow-acting nature may be beneficial by allowing a less frequent injection schedule and greater user comfort. In short cycles, this same trait will just be <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>hindrance, delaying  the  achievement  of  supraphysiological testosterone  levels  (compared  to  faster  testosterone esters) and a strong anabolic effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark293">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark294">Testosterone buciclate has not been studied in women.

Among  bodybuilders, testosterone isobutyrate is often considered analogous to testosterone suspension (no ester). Although both are usually  found  as  water-based  suspensions,  the pharmacokinetics of the two products are admittedly very different. While testosterone (free) suspension is very fast­ acting, requiring injections to be given every few days, testosterone isobutyrate is much slower to release, and is usually administered once every two weeks in a clinical setting.  As  an  injectable  testosterone,  testosterone isobutyrate is favored for its ability to promote rapid gains in muscle mass and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark297">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Injectable   testosterone   isobutyrate   microcrystal suspension was first described in 1952.<span class="s33">391</span><span class="s168">1 </span>This agent was developed in an effort to create an injectable (depot) form of testosterone that would be slower acting that regular (free) testosterone suspension or testosterone propionate, the most widely prescribed forms of testosterone at the time. This is accomplished by providing a microcrystalline depot with very low water solubility, delaying the release of free steroid into the bloodstream. Although effective for this purpose, testosterone isobutyrate was developed at a time when many new esters of testosterone were being introduced to the market. By the mid-1950&#39;s, testosterone enanthate would emerge as the dominant slow-acting injectable testosterone, and the isobutyrate ester would ultimately see little commercial success.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The only modern steroid product to use testosterone isobutyrate is Agovirin Depot, developed by Biotika in Czechoslovakia.

It contains 25 mg/ml of steroid mixed in a water-based solution; packaged in a 2 mL ampule (5 ampules per box). Testosterone isobutyrate has low water solubility; the steroid will noticeably separate from the water-based solution when an ampule is left to sit. A quick shake will temporarily place the drug back into suspension, so that the withdrawn dosage should always be consistent.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark299">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  isobutyrate  is  a  modified  form  of testosterone, where a carboxylic acid ester (2-methyl propionic acid) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free  (unesterified)  steroid.  Testosterone  isobutyrate microcrystalline  suspension  is  designed  to  provide physiological androgen concentrations for approximately 2 weeks following injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark300">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).

Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark301">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark302">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark303">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">3922</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with <span style=" color: #393939;">an </span>aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3933 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">3944 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">3955 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark304">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Although  active  for  longer  periods  of  time,  weekly injections would be preferred due to the low dosage and tendency for pain at the site of injection (large injection volumes would not be advised). To reduce injection volume, the weekly dosage may be further subdivided into smaller injections, which are taken every 2nd or 3rd day. Cycles are generally between 6 and 12 weeks in length. This level is sufficient to provide noticeable gains in muscle size and strength. Testosterone drugs are ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  depending  on  the desired effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone isobutyrate suspension is not commonly used with women in clinical medicine.

It is specifically a 4-chloro derivative, further modified with an acetate ester to slightly slow the release of free steroid from the site of injection. An oral form of the same drug was also made, owing to the fact that 4-chloro substitution increases oral bioavailability to some extent. Norclostebol acetate assays out to be very strong compared to testosterone, with approximately 6.6 times the anabolic potency and 40% of the androgenicity. Comparisons to testosterone propionate, perhaps more valid given the use of an ester, put this steroid at about equal in anabolic potency (112%), with only 20-25% of the androgenicity. Although the exact real-world relevance of these figures remains to be seen, when put into use this agent is very likely to behave as a favorable and primarily anabolic drug, with a low tendency to produce side effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s119" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norclostebol acetate was first described in 1956.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine by Piam, which sold it briefly decades ago under the trade name Anabol 4-19.

An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, norclostebol instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance.

Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, norclostebol is not extensively metabolized by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride. Note that norclostebol is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">higher than with more androgenic agents such as testosterone, methandrostenolone, or fluoxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Norclostebol is not a c17-alpha alkylated compound, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects.

This  agent  is  chemically  identical  to Equipoise®, except in this case the boldenone base has a 17-beta cyclopentenyl (enol) ether attached instead of an undecylenate ester.The ether functions very much like an ester, increasing the fat solubility of the compound. It, however, is used here to increase the oral bioavailability of the hormone, not to prolong its release from an injection site. The design of this steroid is, likewise, very similar to that of Andriol® (testosterone undecanoate), which is also orally administered. With an approximate 7% level of bioavailability, Andriol reminds us that this type of steroid delivery is not very efficient, although with frequent dosing a steady blood hormone level could be achieved. With sufficient  dosing  the  effects  of  this  drug  would  </a><span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>qualitatively  very  similar  to  those  reported  with Equipoise®, providing strength and lean mass gains with low to moderate estrogenic and androgenic activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Quinbolone was first described in 1962.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed during a time when there was growing concern about the hepatotoxicity of oral c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. The focus with this steroid was likely to create a non-toxic clinical  alternative  to  other  anabolic  agents  like methyltestosterone and methandrostenolone, a purpose for which it seemed sufficiently (although not perfectly) suited, at least for some applications. The technology was developed  under  Alberto  Ercoli  of  Vister  Research Laboratories In Casatenovo Italy. Quinbolone was based on Ercoli&#39;s early work with ethers and steroid hormones, first published in 1956.<span class="s33">2 </span>He had actually previously worked with enol ethers of a large number of active steroids, including  testosterone,  nandrolone,  dihydrotestosterone, and methyltestosterone. Quinbolone would be the first commercial ether-modified anabolic steroid to be sold.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Parke Davis released quinbolone as a prescription agent</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_110.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">during the mid-1960&#39;s, sold in Italy under the Anabolicum Vister brand name.This product was manufactured in two distinct forms. The first was an oral soft-gelatin capsule, which carried the steroid dissolved in oil, similar to Andriol. The second was an oral solution, which was administered in measured oral doses similar to those in a bottle of cough syrup.The main clinical uses for Anabolicum Vister seemed to focus on those populations most susceptible to the side effects of anabolic/androgenic steroid therapy, namely women, children, and the elderly. In spite of a seemingly favorable safety record with these groups, quinbolone was withdrawn from the Italian market during the 1970&#39;s. Peculiarly, quinbolone was only sold in Italy, and never had much success with bodybuilders outside of this country.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark322">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: justify;">Quinbolone is no longer commercially available. When produced, it was supplied in the form of 10 mg oral soft gelatin capsules and bottles of oral solution.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark323">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by the introduction of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2,  which  reduces  its  relative  estrogenicity  and androgenicity. Quinbolone contains boldenone modified with the addition of an enol ether (cyclopentenyl) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. The ether-modified hormone is more fat soluble than base (free) boldenone, and is dissolved in a carrier intended for oral administration. Significant  absorption  of  oral  quinbolone  takes  place through the lymphatic route, bypassing the first pass through the liver.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark324">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone  is  aromatized  in  the  body  to  estradiol (estrogen). Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia.  Boldenone  is  considered  a  mildly</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">estrogenic steroid. Aromatization studies suggest that its rate of conversion to estradiol is roughly half that of testosterone.  The  tendency  to  develop  noticeable estrogenic side effects with boldenone should be slightly higher  than  nandrolone,  but  much  lower than with testosterone. Estrogenic side effects are usually not pronounced unless this drug is taken in moderate doses. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate might be used to help mitigate these side effects, should they become present. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), although it is considerably more expensive, and may negatively affect blood lipids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark325">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Note that while boldenone does reduce to a more potent</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">androgen (dihydroboldenone) via the 5alpha reductase enzyme in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic oral anabolic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have  less  effect  on  the  hepatic  management  of cholesterol. The aromatization of boldenone to estradiol may  also  help  to  mitigate  the  negative  effects  of androgens on serum lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark328">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production.

The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   <span style=" color: #393939;">to   </span>hepatic   metabolism.

More specifically, it is a close cousin  of  methyldihydrotestosterone  (mestanolone), differing only by the addition of a 2-hydroxymethylene group. This creates a steroid with considerably different activity than mestanolone, however, such that it is very difficult  to  draw  comparisons  between  the  two.  For starters, oxymethoIone is a very potent anabolic hormone. Dihydrotestosterone and mestanolone are both very weak in this regard, owing to the fact that these molecules are not very stable in the high enzyme (3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)   environment   of   muscle   tissue. OxymethoIone remains highly active here instead, as is reported in standard animal assay tests demonstrating a significantly higher anabolic activity than testosterone or methyltestosterone.   Such   assays   suggest   the androgenicity of oxymethoIone is also very low (1 /4th to <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>/7th its anabolic activity), although real world results in humans suggest it is decidedly higher than that.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone is considered by many to be the most powerful steroid commercially available. A steroid novice experimenting with this agent is likely to gain 20 to 30 pounds of massive bulk, and it can often be accomplished within 6 weeks of use. This steroid produces a lot of water retention, so a good portion of this gain is going to be water weight.This is often of little consequence to the user, who may be feeling very big and strong while taking oxymethoIone. Although the smooth look that results from water retention is often not attractive, it can aid quite a bit to the level of size and strength gained.The muscle is fuller, will contract better, and is provided a level of protection in the form of extra water held into and around connective tissues.This will allow for more elasticity, and will hopefully decrease the chance for injury when lifting heavy. It should be noted, however, that a very rapid gain in mass might also place too much stress on your connective tissues.The tearing  of  pectoral  and  biceps  tissue  is  commonly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_113.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">associated with heavy lifting while massing up on steroids, and oxymethoIone is a common offender. There can be such a thing as gaining too fast.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark335">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone was first described in 1959.<span class="s50">1 </span>The agent was released in the United States as a prescription drug during the early 1960&#39;s, sold under the brand names Anadrol-50 (Syntex)  and  Androyd  (Parke  Davis  &amp;  Co.).  Syntex developed the agent, and would hold patent rights to it until their expiration many years later. The drug was originally approved for use in conditions where anabolic action was necessary. Indicated uses included geriatric debilitation,  chronic  underweight  states,  pre-  and postoperative preservation of lean mass, convalescence from infection, gastrointestinal disease, osteoporosis, and general catabolic conditions. The recommended dose for such uses was usually 2.5 mg three times per day.The drug was originally supplied in a 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg tablet.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In spite of the many potential therapeutic uses or a strong anabolic activity of this drug, the FDA soon strictly narrowed the indicated uses of oxymethoIone. By the mid- 1970&#39;s, the drug was FDA approved only for the indicated treatment of anemia characterized by deficient red blood cell  (RBC)  production.  Admittedly  the  stimulation  of erythropoiesis is an affect that is characteristic of nearly all anabolic steroids, which as a group tend to increase RBC concentrations.  OxymethoIone, however,  seemed fairly reliable in this regard; demonstrating an increase in erythropoietin levels as much as 5 fold.<span class="s33">2 </span>This has led to its adoption for this relatively new medical use, as well as the institution of a higher (50 mg) dosage with the updated Anadrol-50 product, necessary for a stronger effect on RBC count. The Parke Davis item would not be brought up to the higher dosage, however, and was discontinued.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Recent years have brought fourth a number of new treatments for anemia, most notably Epogen (recombinant erythropoietin) and related erythropoietic peptides.These</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">drugs directly mimic the body&#39;s natural red blood cell producing hormone, and as such provide a much more focused form of therapy, with less of the unrelated side effects one would have to endure with the use of a strong androgen. Although Anadrol was once viewed as an effective drug for this purpose, sales were now dropping. Financial  disinterest  finally  prompted  Syntex  to  halt production of the U.S. Anadrol 50 in 1993, which was around the same time they decided to drop this item in a number of foreign countries. Plenastril from Switzerland and Austria were dropped; following soon was Oxitosona from Spain. During the mid-1990&#39;s, many Athletes feared oxymethoIone was on the way out for good.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In July 1997, Syntex sold all rights to Anadrol-50 in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to Unimed Pharmaceuticals. Unimed reintroduced Anadrol-50 to the U.S. market in 1998, this time targeting HIV/AIDS patients. Patients with HIV are commonly anemic, often caused by the disease itself, opportunistic infections, or the antiretroviral drugs used to treat the disease. The anemia in HIV patients is typically  categorized  by  impaired  red  blood  cell production in bone marrow, the FDA approved indication for oxymethoIone use. Adding to this, oxymethoIone was showing  great  promise  in  studies  combating  HIV associated wasting. Unimed soon initiated Phase ll/lll trials with Anadrol for HIV wasting syndrome, and continued to research its use for treating such things as chronic obstructive  pulmonary  disease  and  lipodystrophy  (a disorder characterized by a selective loss of body fat, insulin resistance, diabetes, high triglycerides levels, and <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>fatty liver).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark336">Since the early 2000s, the production of oxymethoIone has been sporadic, especially in the United States. The intellectual property for Anadrol-50 has changed hands several times, first being sold from Solvay/Unimed to Alaven Pharmaceutical, then placed under Meda&#39;s control during company acquisition, and more recently sold again to Mylan Specialty (2012). In all cases, the drug retained its narrow FDA approved therapeutic application for treating red blood cell deficient anemia.The cost at the pharmacy has been exceedingly high, precluding much diversion. OxymethoIone remains available outside of the United States, although it is mostly sold in countries where steroids are less tightly regulated. Syntex seems to have removed itself from the market globally, discontinuing production or transferring license to other companies whenever possible.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone is available in select human drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer. Most brands contain 50 mg of steroid per tablet.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark337">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone is a modified form of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha, which helps protect the hormone during oral administration,  and  2)  the  introduction  of  a  2- hydroxymethylene group, which inhibits its metabolism by the 3-hsd enzyme and greatly enhances the anabolic and    relative    biological    activity    of methyldihydrotestosterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark338">Substance Identification:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone  can  be  positively  identified  with ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp; C. The drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) dark yellow color change in Substance Test A. When using Substance Test C, it should produce an immediate color change to maroon.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark339">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone  is  a  highly  estrogenic  steroid. Gynecomastia is often a concern during treatment, and may present itself quite early into a cycle (particularly when higher doses are used). At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build.To avoid strong estrogenic side effects, it may be necessary to use an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex® or Ciomid®.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark340">It is important to note that oxymethoIone does not directly convert to estrogen in the body. This steroid is a derivative of dihydrotestosterone, and as such cannot be aromatized. Anti-aromatase compounds such as Cytadren and  Arimidex®  will,  likewise,  not  effect  the  relative estrogenicity of this steroid. Some have suggested that the high level of estrogenic activity in oxymethoIone is actually due to the drug acting as a progestin, similar to nandrolone. The side effects of both estrogens and progestins can be very similar, which might have made this explanation a plausible one. There was a medical study  examining  the  progestational  activity  of oxymethoIone, however, and it determined that there was no such activity present.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>With such findings, it seems most  plausible  that  oxymethoIone  can  activate  the estrogen receptor, similar to, but more profoundly than, the estrogenic androgen methandriol.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although  oxymethoIone  is  classified  as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance.These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Higher doses are more likely to cause such side effects. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">additionally warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. While Anadrol is classified as an anabolic steroid, it does retain a notable androgenic component.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is interesting to note that oxymethoIone does exhibit some tendency to convert to dihydrotestosterone in the body, although this does not occur via the 5-alpha reductase  enzyme.  OxymethoIone  is  already  a dihydrotestosterone-based steroid, so no such alteration can take place. Aside from the added c-17alpha alkylation (discussed below), oxymethoIone differs from DHT only by the addition of a 2-hydroxymethylene group. This grouping  can  be  removed  metabolically,  reducing oxymethoIone to the potent androgen 17alpha-methyl dihydrotestosterone (mestanolone).<span class="s33">4 </span>There is little doubt that this biotransformation contributes at least on some level to the androgenic nature of this steroid. Note that since 5-alpha reductase is not involved, the relative androgenicity of oxymethoIone is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone is a c!7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone has a saturated A-ring, which slightly reduces  its  relative  hepatotoxicity.<span class="s33">5  </span>Still,  this  agent, particularly at the doses commonly used, can present substantial  hepatotoxicity  to  the  user.  Studies administering 50 mg or 100 mg daily to 31 elderly men for 12 weeks produced significant increases in liver enzymes (transaminases AST and ALT) only <span style=" color: #393939;">in patients </span>taking 100 mg. A second study administering 50 mg daily to 30 patients for up to and exceeding one year (in some patients)  has  demonstrated  elevations  in  y- glutamyltransferase (GGT) in 17% of patients, significant increases in bilirubin in 10%,and serum albumin increases in 20%.<span class="s33">6 </span>One patient developed a liver tumor that could have been peliosis hepatitis, a life-threatening adverse event characterized by blood filled cysts in the liver. A small number of other cases of peliosis hepatitis have been linked to oxymethoIone, suggesting the potential</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">for hepatotoxicity should still be carefully considered before use.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark341">The use of </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">OxymethoIone  has  a  strong  effect  on  the  hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown and route of administration. Studies administering 50 mg or 100 mg daily to a group of elderly men  for  12  weeks  have  demonstrated  insignificant increases  in  LDL  cholesterol,  accompanied  by  very significant (dramatic) suppressions of HDL cholesterol (reduced 19 and 23 points in the 50 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively).<span class="s33">7 </span>The use of oxymethoIone should be undertaken only after careful consideration in people with high cholesterol or a familial history of heart disease.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Note that when discontinuing oxymethoIone, the crash can be as equally powerful as the on-cycle results. To begin with, the level of water retention will quickly diminish, dropping the user&#39;s body weight dramatically. This should be expected, and not of much concern. What is usually of most concern is restoring endogenous testosterone production with a proper PCT program (see: Post Cycle Therapy in this book). Before going off, some alternately  choose  to  first  switch  over  to  a  milder injectable like Deca-Durabolin® for several weeks.This is in an effort to &quot;harden up the new mass,&quot; and can prove to be an effective practice, at least from a mental standpoint. A drop of weight is likely when making the switch, although the end result is still often viewed as allowing the retention of more (quality) muscle mass. It is sort of stepping down, first off the water retention, and weeks later finally off the hormones. Remember ancillaries though,  as  testosterone  production  will  not  be rebounding during Deca therapy.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, an effective oral daily dosage would fall in the range of 25-150 mg, taken in cycles lasting no more than 6-8 weeks to minimize hepatotoxicity.  This  level  is  sufficient  for  dramatic increases in muscle mass and strength. Higher doses are rarely administered due to the strong estrogenic nature of the drug, as well as the high potential for hepatotoxicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark344">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark345">Prescribing information for oxymethoIone in the U.S. makes  no  distinction  with  the  dose  for  females.

Doses as high as 30 mg were employed in some cases.  Current  prescribing  guidelines  recommend  a dosage of 1-5 mg per kilogram of bodyweight per day for treating anemia, although indicate that a dose of 1-2 mg/kg is typically sufficient. A 175-pound person would take approximately 150 mg per day at the 2 mg/kg dosage level. In some other countries, it is recommended to limit the dosing of oxymethoIone to 100 mg per day. Therapy is usually given for a minimum of three to six months.  When  used  for  physique-  or  performance­ enhancing purposes, an effective oral daily dosage would fall in the range of 25-150 mg, taken in cycles lasting no more than 6-8 weeks to minimize hepatotoxicity.This level is sufficient for dramatic increases in muscle mass and strength.

Hexyloxyphenyipropionate,      also      called parahexyloxyphenylpropionate,  is  a  fairly  unusual nandrolone ester in a structural sense. It is essentially nandrolone phenylpropionate, which has been extended with a tail of one additional oxygen atom and 6 more carbons. It is the largest, and likely the slowest acting, ester of nandrolone to ever be introduced into clinical medicine. It is considerably slower acting than the popular Deca- Durabolin (nandrolone decanoate), and generally would be administered once every three to four weeks in a medical setting. Nandrolone hexyloxyphenyipropionate is no longer manufactured, but when available was favored by athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to promote slow steady gains in lean mass with low estrogenic and androgenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark349">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone hexyloxyphenyipropionate was first described in I960.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine shortly after, and was sold mainly under the Anadur brand name in such markets  as  Austria,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany. Anadur persisted through the early 1990&#39;s, and, following some mergersand acquisitions, was sold mainly by Kabi Pharmacia.Kabi would also sell the drug in France, but under the brand name Anador. Indicated uses for the drug included osteoporosis, chronic renal  and  intestinal  disorders,  and  radiation  and chemotherapy induced suppression of red blood cells (anemia). It was also used as a general lean-tissue-building anabolic,  with  certain  diseased  states,  injury,  or convalescence.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone  hexyloxyphenyipropionate  was  not  widely distributed outside of Europe, and in spite of a long history of relative safety, would not last as a medicinal product.The 1995 merger of Kabi with Upjohn formed the company</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_119.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark350">Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, and would soon spell the commercial end to Anadur. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn did continue to market the drug in Austria, but only briefly, and soon refined its offerings  to  eliminate  all  forms  of  nandrolone hexyloxyphenyipropionate in all countries.lt is of note that this ester of nandrolone was also sold by Leo in Spain (Anadur), Lundbeck in Denmark (Anadur), Eczacibasi in Turkey (Anadur), and by Xponei in Greece (Anadurin), much under direct license with Kabi. All such preparations have since been discontinued as well, however, and nandrolone  hexyloxyphenyipropionate  is  no  longer available as a commercial medicine.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark351">Nandrolone  hexyloxyphenyipropionate  is  no  longer available as a prescription drug product. When supplied, it usually contained 25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL of steroid dissolved in oil in a 1 mL or 2 mL ampule.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone hexyloxyphenyipropionate is a modified form of  nandrolone,  where  a  carboxylic  acid  ester (parahexyloxyphenylpropionic acid) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids  are  designed  to  prolong  the  window  of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free     (unesterified)     steroid.     Nandrolone hexyloxyphenyipropionate is designed to provide a slow release of nandrolone for up to four weeks following injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark352">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">testosterone.<span class="s33">2 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">3 </span>Consequently, estrogen related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark353">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as a progestin in the body.</a><span class="s33">4 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">5  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to interfering with libido in males when used without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark354">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).</a><span class="s33">6  7  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark355">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">8 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">9   </span>Nandrolone   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark356">also recommended.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. For sake of comparison, studies administering <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>00 mg per week of nandrolone decanoate for 6 weeks have demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy. At a dosage of 300 mg per week, this reduction  reached  7O%.<span class="s33">10  </span>It  is  believed  that  the progestational activity of nandrolone notably contributes to  the  suppression  of  testosterone  synthesis  during therapy, which can be marked in spite of a low tendency for estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">11  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Stenbolone  was actually developed on a 1 -testosterone backbone,differing only by the addition of a 2-methyl group. The resulting steroid remains very similar to its non-methylated base, with only modest differences in anabolic and androgenic potency.  On  the  tissue-building  side,  stenbolone  is probably a little weaker on a milligram for milligram basis than 1-testosterone, although it is difficult to make direct comparisons. As an androgen, stenbolone is also probably slightly weaker than 1-testosterone, when you are talking milligram   for   milligram   dose,   although   the anabolic/androgenic ratio (the more relevant measure) remains very similar. When compared to testosterone, standard assays suggest that stenbolone has roughly three times greater anabolic effect, and somewhere between 15% and 30% more androgenic activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark361">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Schering AG in Germany introduced stenbolone acetate in 1961.  Approximately  two  years  later,  Syntex  would introduce the drug to the United Kingdom, and soon after Mexico, under the brand name Anatrofin. Farmacologico Latino also sold this drug in Spain, under the generic name Stenbolone.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was reportedly applied (most commonly) as an injectable alternative to Anadrol in cases of Anemia, although little information about the clinical use of this agent  survives  today.  The  distribution  of  stenbolone acetate did not expand from its original markets, and ultimately  enjoyed  a  relatively  short  lifespan  as  a pharmaceutical product. The last commercial preparation containing this ingredient was reportedly withdrawn from market (voluntarily) in the early 1980s. Its demise was likely financially driven, as Anatrofin disappeared at a time when many pharmaceutical manufacturers were dropping their lesser-used anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">European  bodybuilders  were  disappointed  when</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark362">Anatrofin was removed from the global market a couple of decades ago. Its loss was a hard felt one, very much like the old  Primobolan  acetate  injectables.  Old  timers  often claimed that the likes of this steroid were never replaced with  the  other  popular  non-aromatizable  anabolics. Whether or not this is based on realistic experience or simple nostalgia remains to be seen, it is difficult today to say  how  different  this  agent  ultimately  is  from methenolone  or  1-testosterone,  close  chemical  and pharmacological relatives which we have much more modern experience with. Until such time as this agent goes into wide-scale production again, which seems unlikely (at least  as  a  prescription  product),  the  true  nature  of stenbolone  will  remain  elusive  to  the  modern bodybuilding  community.  This  steroid  does,  however, remain as an interesting chapter in the history of anabolic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark363">Stenbolone acetate is no longer available as a prescription drug product.

It contains one additional double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and one additional methyl group at carbon 2, which helps to stabilize the 3-keto group and increase the steroid&#39;s  anabolic  properties.  Anatrofin makes use of stenbolone with a carboxylic acid ester (acetic acid) attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) stenbolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark364">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark365">Stenbolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark366">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, particularly with higher than normal therapeutic doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes </a><span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Stenbolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue­ building  actions,  making  the  threshold  for  strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more  androgenic  agents  such  as  testosterone, methandrostenolone,  or  fluoxymesterone.  Note  that stenbolone  is  unaffected  by  the  5-alpha  reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">Stenbolone is not a c17-alpha alkylated compound, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects.

The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Stenbolone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandroione due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a much weaker impact than c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark368">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize </a><span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark369">The above side effects are not inclusive.

It was designed to have a very strong separation of anabolic and androgenic effect, and no significant   estrogenic   or   progestational   activity. Oxandrolone is noted for being quite mild as far as oral steroids are concerned, well tailored for the promotion <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>strength  and  quality  muscle  tissue  gains  without significant side effects.

Searle <i><b>&amp; Co. </b></i>(now Pfizer), which sold it in the United States and the Netherlands under the Anavar trade name. Searle also sold/licensed the drug under different trade names including Lonavar (Argentina, Australia), Lipidex (Brazil), Antitriol (Spain), Anatrophill (France), and Protivar. Oxandrolone was designed to be an extremely mild oral anabolic, one that could even be used safely by women and children. In this regard Searle seems to have succeeded, as Anavar has shown a high degree of therapeutic success and tolerability in men, women, and children alike. During its early years, Anavar had been offered fora number of therapeutic applications, including the promotion of lean tissue growth during catabolic illness, the promotion of lean tissue growth following surgery,  trauma,  infection,  or  prolonged  corticosteroid administration, or the support of bone density in patients with osteoporosis.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">By the 1980&#39;s, the FDA had slightly refined the approved applications of oxandrolone to include the promotion of</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_126.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">weight gain following surgery, chronic infection,trauma, or weight loss without definite pathophysiologic reason. In spite of its ongoing track record of safety, Searle decided to voluntarily discontinue the sale of Anavar on July 1, 1989. Lagging sales and growing public concern about the athletic use of anabolic steroids appeared to be at the root of this decision. With the Anavar brand off the market, oxandrolone  had  completely  vanished  from  U.S. pharmacies.  Soon  after,  oxandrolone  products  in international markets (often sold by or under license from Searle) began to disappear as well, as the leading global manufacturer of the drug continued its withdrawal from the anabolic steroid business. For several years during the early 1990&#39;s, it looked as if Anavar might be on its way out of commerce for good.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It would be approximately six years before oxandrolone tablets would be back on the U.S. market. The product returned to pharmacy shelves in December 1995, this time under the Oxandrin name by Bio-Technology General Corp. (BTG). BTG would continue selling it for the FDA approved uses involving lean mass preservation, but had also been granted orphan-drug status for the treatment of AIDS wasting, alcoholic hepatitis, Turner&#39;s syndrome in girls, and constitutional delay of growth and puberty in boys. Orphan drug status gave BTG a 7-year monopoly on the drug for these new uses, allowing them to protect a very high selling price. Many patients were outraged to learn that the drug would cost them (at wholesale price) between $3.75 and $30 per day, which was many times more costly than Anavar had been just several years back. The release of a 10 mg tablet from BTG several years later did little to reduce the relative cost of the drug.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrin® continues to be sold in the U.S., but is now owned by Gemini Laboratories. It is currently approved by the FDA for &quot;adjunctive therapy to promote weight gain after weight loss following extensive surgery, chronic infections, or severe trauma and in some patients who without definite pathophysiologic reasons fail to gain or to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">maintain normal weight, to offset the protein catabolism associated   with   prolonged   administration   of corticosteroids, and for the relief of the bone pain frequently accompanying osteoporosis.&quot;Generic versions of the drug have also been approved, which has reduced the cost of therapy to some extent. Outside of the U.S., oxandrolone remains available, although not widely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark376">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrolone is available in select human drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer. The original Anavar brand contained 2,5 mg of steroid per tablet. Oxandrin contains 2.5 mg or 10 mg per tablet. Other modern brands commonly contain</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark377">2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of steroid per tablet.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrolone is a modified form of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the substitution of carbon-2 in the A-ring with an oxygen atom. Oxandrolone is the only commercially available steroid with such a substitution to its basic ring structure, an alteration that considerably increases the anabolic strength of the steroid (partly by making it resistant   to   metabolism   by   3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in skeletal muscle tissue).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark378">Substance Identification:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark379">Oxandrolone can be positively identified with ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests B &amp; C.The drug should produce a slow color change to yellow-green in Substance Test C, which can take up to 10-15 minutes to be visible.With Substance Test B, it should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) cream color reaction.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic.Oxandrolone also offers no related progestational  activity.<span class="s33">4233  </span>An  anti-estrogen  is  not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should  not  be  a  concern  even  among  sensitive individuals.

This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns. Oxandrolone is also very popular among athletes  in  strength/speed  sports  such  as  sprinting, swimming,and gymnastics. In such disciplines one usually does not want to carry around excess water weight, and may  find  the  raw  muscle-growth  brought  about  by oxandrolone to be quite favorable over the lower quality</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark380">mass gains of aromatizable agents.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Oxandrolone is a steroid with low  androgenic  activity  relative  to  its  tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such as testosterone, methandrostenolone, or fluoxymesterone.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark381">The low androgenic activity of oxandrolone is due in part to it being a derivative of dihydrotestosterone.This creates a less androgenic steroid because the agent lacks the capacity to interact with the 5-alpha reductase enzyme and convert to a more potent&quot;di-hydro&quot;form.This is unlike testosterone, which is several times more active in androgen responsive target tissues such as the scalp, skin, and prostate (where 5-alpha reductase is present in high amounts) due to its conversion to DHT. In essence, oxandrolone has a more balanced level of potency between muscle and androgenic target tissues. This is a similar situation as is noted with Primobotan and Winstrol, which are also derived from dihydrotestosterone and not known to be very androgenic substances.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrolone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl  7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxandrolone appears to offer less hepatic stress than other c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. The manufacturer identifies oxandrolone as a steroid that is not extensively metabolized by the liver like other 17-alpha alkylated orals, which may be a factor in its reduced hepatotoxicity. This is evidenced by the fact that more than a third of the compound is still intact when excreted in the urine.<span class="s33">4244</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Another study comparing the effects of oxandrolone to other  alkylated  agents  including  methyltestosterone, norethandrolone,  fluoxymesterone,  and  methandriol demonstrated  that  oxandrolone  causes  the  lowest sulfobromophthalein (BSP; a marker of liver stress) retention of the agents tested.<span class="s33">4255 </span>20 mg of oxandrolone produced 72% less BSP retention than an equal dosage of fluoxymesterone, which is a considerable difference being that they are both 17-alpha alkylated.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">A more recent study looked at escalating doses (20 mg, 40 mg,and 80 mg) of oxandrolone in 262 HIV+ men.The drug was administered for a period of 12 weeks. The group taking  20  mg  of  oxandrolone  per  day  showed  no statistically significant trends of hepatotoxicity in liver enzyme  (AST/ALT;  aminotransferase  and  alanine aminotransferase) values. Those men taking 40 mg noticed a mean increase of approximately 30-50% in liver enzyme values, while the group of men taking 80 mg noticed an approximate 50-100% increase.

This figure jumped to 15% in the 80 mg  group.  While  serious  hepatotoxicity  cannot  be excluded with oxandrolone, these studies do suggest that it is measurably safer than other alkylated agents.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark382">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  In  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Oxandrolone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol  due  to  its  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown,  non-aromatizable  nature,  and  route  of administration. In the previously cited study in HIV+ males, 20 mg of oxandrolone daily for 12 weeks caused a mean serum HDL reduction of 30%. HDL values were suppressed 33% in the 40 mg group, and 50% in the 80 mg group. This was accompanied by a statistically significant increase in LDL values (approximately 30-33%) in the 40 mg and 80 mg groups, further increasing atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">At one time oxandrolone was looked at as a possible drug for those suffering from disorders of high cholesterol or triglycerides. Early studies showed it to be capable of lowering  total  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  values  in certain  types  of  hyperlipidemic  patients,  which  was thought to signify potential for this drug as a lipid- lowering  agent.<span class="s33">4266  </span>With  further  investigation  it  was found, however, that any lowering of total cholesterol values was accompanied by a redistribution in the ratio of good (HDL) to bad (LDL) cholesterol that favored greater atherogenic risk.<span class="s33">4277 4288 </span>This negates any positive effect this drug might have on triglycerides or total cholesterol, and actually makes it a potential danger in terms of cardiac risk, especially when taken for prolonged periods of  time.  Today  we  understand  that  as  a  group, anabolic/androgenic   steroids   tend   to   produce unfavorable changes in lipid profiles, and are really not useful in disorders of lipid metabolism. As an oral c17 alpha alkylated steroid, oxandrolone is even more risky to use in this regard than an esterified injectable such as a testosterone or nandrolone.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark383">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

This was usually recommended for a period of two to four weeks, but occasionally it was taken for as long as three months. The dosing guidelines recommended with the current U.S. production form of the drug (Oxandrin, Savient Pharmaceuticals) also call for between 2.5 and 20 mg of drug per day, taken in intermittent cycles of 2 to 4 weeks. The usual dosage for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes is in the range of 15-25 mg per day, taken for 6 <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>8 weeks.These protocols are not far removed from those of normal therapeutic situations.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark386">Oxandrolone is often combined with other steroids for a more dramatic result. For example, while bulking one might opt to add in 200-400 mg of a testosterone ester (cypionate, enanthate, or propionate) per week.The result should be a considerable gain in new muscle mass, with a more comfortable level of water and fat retention than if taking a higher dose of testosterone alone. For dieting phases, one might alternately combine oxandrolone with a non-aromatizing steroid such as 150 mg per week of a trenbolone  ester  or  200-300  mg  of  Primobolan® (methenolone enanthate). Such stacks are highly favored for increasing definition and muscularity. An in-between (lean mass gain) might be to add in 200-400 mg of a low estrogenic compound like Deca-Durabolin® (nandrolone decanoate) or Equipoise® (boldenone undecylenate).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The original prescribing guidelines for Anavar did not offer  separate  dosing  recommendations  for  women, although  it  was  indicated  that  women  who  were pregnant, or may become pregnant, should not use the drug.

This product comes in the form of a transdermal   gel,   typically   containing   2.5% dihydrotestosterone by weight in an 80gram tube. As with Androgel, roughly 10% of the active steroid will make it into circulation with each application.This would equate to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">80  doses  of  25  mg,  with  each  dose  delivering approximately  2.5  mg  of  steroid  to  the  body. Dihydrotestosterone itself is the most active androgen in the human body, displaying an ability to bind and activate the androgen receptor at least three or four times greater than that of its parent steroid testosterone. This trait, however, is not accompanied by equally powerful anabolic tendencies. In the case of dihydrotestosterone, we have a steroid that is almost purely androgenic, with only minimal muscle-building (anabolic) action.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dihydrotestosterone is a weak muscle builder because it is extremely  open  to  alteration  by  the  3-alpha- hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase  enzyme,  responsible  for breaking down active steroids like DHT into their inactive metabolites.3a-HSD is present in high quantities in muscle tissue,  running  interference  between  the  outer  cell membrane and the androgen receptors that all steroid hormones are trying to reach. In humans, little DHT ends up actually  reaching  this  receptor.  Testosterone  is  very resistant to this enzyme, however, which allows it to be a much  more  effective  muscle-building  agent.  3a-HSD steroid deactivation in muscle tissue causes the same problem  with  Proviron  (1-methyl-dihydrotestosterone). DHT and Proviron both have very effective uses in areas such as fat loss, hardening, increasing CNS activity, and pure strength gains, but they do not perform well as anabolic agents.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark389">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dihydrotestosterone was first synthesized in 1935.<span class="s33">1 </span>This</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_132.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">strong androgen was put into consistent medical use during the late 1950&#39;s, after a series of experiments demonstrating that it had measurable anabolic effects. Prior to this it was largely believed that DHT was exclusively an androgenic substance, and wasof little value clinically. Dihydrotestosterone gels were developed more recently, and have been investigated for a number of medical purposes. At present, these preparations are primarily  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  androgen deficiency, gynecomastia, and insufficient genital growth. Transdermal DHT has been successful as an androgen replacement  medication  in  older  men  at  risk  for developing prostate hypertrophy largely because of its non-aromatizable nature,<span class="s33">2 3 </span>as this disorder is fueled partly by estrogens. The latter two indications are considered local applications of the drug, and the DHT gel is applied directly to the tissues requiring treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  primary  manufacturer  of  dihydrotestosterone  gel globally is Besins International, based in France. Besins produces the drug under the Andractim name, selling it in France  and  scarcely  in  other  parts  of  Europe. Dihydrotestosterone gels are found much less commonly outside of Europe, and presently no such preparation is commercially available in the United States. In 1995, U.S. manufacturer  Unimed  Pharmaceuticals  purchased  the rights to Andractim from Besins in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. The firm announced an interest in the drug for several uses, including androgen replacement in men over age  sixty,  treating  benign  prostate  hypertrophy,  and combating HIV- associated wasting. Its use as an anabolic may be desirable with HIV because it had been determined that many patients lack an ability to properly convert testosterone to DHT, and therefore lack sufficient levels of this important androgen. It appears that Unimed has since sold its interests in the anabolic steroid market, however, leaving the potential reemergence of dihydrotestosterone in the U.S.in question.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark390">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hydroalcoholic transdermal dihydrotestosterone gels are available in select human drug markets.

Approximately 10% of the applied dose is absorbed across the skin during each 24-hour period.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark392">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dihydrotestosterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not  measurably  estrogenic.  An  anti-estrogen  is  not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia and water retention should not be concerns even among sensitive  individuals.  DHT  also  has  inherent  anti­ estrogenic properties, competing with other substrates for binding to the aromatase enzyme. Percutaneous dihydrotestosterone may be an effective option for the treatment of gynecomastia. Studies have reported a good level of success when treating certain forms of this disorder with Andractim, the drug affecting the ratio of androgenic to estrogenic action in the breast area enough that a notable regression of mammary tissue has been achieved in many cases.<span class="s33">4 </span><span class="s50">5</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark393">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Dihydrotestosterone  is  the  strongest  natural  male androgen. Higher than normal therapeutic doses are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Men with a genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Women are warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as dihydrotestosterone.These may include</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and  myocardial  infarction.  Therapeutic  doses  of dihydrotestosterone used to correct insufficient androgen production in otherwise healthy aging men are unlikely to increase atherogenic risk. Higher doses are likely to increase atherogenic risk, but less dramatically than equivalent doses of synthetic oral anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark396">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

This drug is very different than most oral anabolic steroids, which are usually c-17 alpha alkylated to survive first pass metabolism through the liver. Instead, esterification and suspension in oil allows the testosterone undecanoate in Andriol® to be partially absorbed through the lymphatic system along with dietary fat.This bypasses the destructive first-pass through liver, providing sustained physiological levels of testosterone to the body.The actual oral  bioavailability  of  Andriol  is  estimated  to  be approximately 7%. In design, this steroid is essentially a non-toxic  and  orally  active  testosterone,  intended  to provide a unique alternative to testosterone injections and other hepatotoxic oral anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark401">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oral testosterone undecanoate capsules were developed <span style=" color: #393939;">by </span>international drug giant Organon (now Merck/MSD), and first introduced into clinical trials during the early 1980&#39;s. The drug was soon approved for use as a prescription agent in a number of countries around the globe, generally under the Andriol brand name, although Organon has also marketed it as Androxon, Panteston, Restandol, Undestor, and Virigen in certain markets. This drug preparation is indicated for testosterone replacement therapy  in  males  with  conditions  associated  with insufficient endogenous androgen production. Although there is a large market for androgen replacement drugs in the United States, the drug is not approved for sale on the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">U.S. market. It has been approved as a prescription agent in the bordering markets of Mexico and Canada, however.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 2003, Organon began replacing its Andriol products with Andriol® Testocaps®. The new formulation improves on  the  storage  limitations  of  the  original  Andriol preparations, which needed to be kept under refrigeration at the pharmacy.The drug was stored at room temperature</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">once dispensed, as the product needed to be consumed at room temperature. Outside of refrigeration, however, the drug functionally had only a 3-month shelf life. The new Andriol Testocaps are designed to always be stored at room temperature, and have a shelflife of 3 years. The new formulation is considered to be bioequivalent to the older version, and can be substituted in patients without any change in dosage.<span class="s33">1 </span>Given the handling advantages and bioequivalency, it is likely that the new Testocaps will slowly  come  to  replace  all  of  the  older  Andriol preparations.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark402">In spite of its wide availability, Andriol has never been a popular item among athletes.This is likely due to the high relative cost of the drug, and its low potency compared to other pharmaceutical preparations, particularly injectable testosterone compounds and the more potent synthetic oral anabolic steroids. Still, Andriol remains a product of choice among those athletes not interested in using injectable medications and preferring to avoid the greater risks of hepatotoxicity and lipid alterations inherent in c-17 alpha alkylated orals.Today, decades after its initial release, Merck/MSD  remains  the  sole  global  producer  of prescription oral testosterone undecanoate. Andriol itself has maintained a prominent share of the global hormone replacement market since the 1990&#39;s.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oral testosterone undecanoate preparations are available in various human drug markets. The older formulations supply 40 mg of testosterone undecanoate in oleic acid, contained in small soft gelatin capsules. Andriol Testocaps supplies 40 mg of testosterone undecanoate in castor oil and propylene glycol monolaurate, contained in small soft gelatin capsules. Packaging is commonly as bottles of 30 or 60 capsules, or foil/plastic strips of 10 capsules. Subtracting the ester weight, each 40 mg Andriol capsule contains</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">25.3mg of (base) testosterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark403">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Andriol® contains testosterone that has been modified with the addition of carboxylic acid ester (undecanoic acid) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. The esterified hormone is more fat soluble than base (free) testosterone, and has been dissolved in oil and encapsulated for oral administration. Significant absorption of oral testosterone undecanoate takes place through the lymphatic route, bypassing the first pass through the liver. Andriol® is designed to provide a peak in testosterone levels several hours after administration, and with repeated dosing maintain physiological concentrations for 24 hours.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Pharmacokinetics of</p><p class="s9" style="padding-bottom: 3pt;padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Oral Testosterone Undecanoate</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="280" height="196" alt="image" src="img/Image_135.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: center;">Figure 1.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic  steroid.  Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  will increase the likelihood of estrogenic side effects. In such cases, an anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen  citrate  is  commonly  applied  to  prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark405">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Taking oral testosterone undecanoate in doses exceeding normal therapeutic levels is likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Men with a genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark406">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity with high doses of oral testosterone by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including serum albumin, bilirubin,   alanine-amino-transferase,   and   alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">2 </span>No study in which liver enzymes were examined  has  demonstrated  an  adverse  hepatotoxic effect from Andriol, including an examination of patients on continuous therapy for 10 years.<span class="s33">3</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark407">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Therapeutic doses of oral testosterone undecanoate used to correct insufficient androgen production in otherwise healthy aging men are unlikely to increase atherogenic risk, and may actually improve lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark408">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">generally call for a minimum dosage of 240-280 mg per day (6-8 capsules), taken in cycles of 6-8 weeks. A more common effective dosage, however, would fall in the range of 400-480 mg <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(10 </span>to 12 capsules) per day. These doses can be quite costly given the relative price of Andriol  preparations,  making  injectable  testosterones much more cost effective and popular.

The testosterone itself is dissolved in an alcoholic gel similar to AndroGel®, except here the gel is contained in a protected external drug reservoir. This design provides approximately  double  the  hormone  bioavailability  of AndroGel®,  and  also  severely  limits  the  transfer  of testosterone to other people during rigorous skin-to-skin contact. The patches come in two strengths, 2.5 mg and 5 mg, indicating the amount of testosterone each is to supply systemically over a 24-hour period (they contain 12.2  and  24.3mg  of  testosterone  respectively). Androderm® was designed to mimic the natural circadian rhythm of testosterone release in healthy young men, higher during the first 12 hours and lower during the next 12 hours of each day.The clinical significance of this, if any, is not known.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Androderm® was developed in the United States by TheraTech (Salt Lake City). It was approved for sale as a prescription agent by the Food and Drug Administration in September  1995,  and  is  indicated  for  testosterone replacement therapy in men with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.This includes cases of primary hypogonadism, which may be caused by cryptorchidism, bilateral  torsion,  orchitis,  vanishing  testis  syndrome, orchiectomy,  Klinefelter&#39;s  syndrome,  chemotherapy,  or alcohol/heavy metal toxicity. It is also prescribed to treat hypogonadotrophic  hypogonadism,  including  patients with luteinizing hormone or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency caused by tumors, injury, or radiation. Primary hypogonadism is usually characterized by low testosterone and high gonadotropin (LH/FSH) levels, while hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is usually associated with low testosterone and low to normal gonadotropin levels.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic  steroid.  Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  will increase the likelihood of estrogenic side effects. In such cases, an anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen  citrate  is  commonly  applied  to  prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  is  likely  to  produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Women are warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen  such  as  testosterone.  These  may  include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark420">per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and  myocardial  infarction.  Therapeutic  doses  of testosterone  used  to  correct  insufficient  androgen production in otherwise healthy aging men are unlikely to increase atherogenic risk, and may actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark421">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The site(s) of application should be rotated so that no patch is reapplied to the same area in less than 7 days. Lower bioavailability may be noticed in some areas of the body, such as the chest and calves. Androderm should not be applied to the scrotum. It should also not be applied over a bony area of the body, or any part of the body that could be subject to prolonged pressure during sleep or sitting. Application to these sites has been associated with burn-like  blister  reactions.  Skin  irritation  causes approximately 1 in 20 patients to discontinue treatment. Irritation may be ameliorated by treatment of the affected area with over-the-counter topical hydrocortisone cream applied after the patch is removed. A small amount of prescription 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide cream may also be applied to the center of each patch before application,  which  should  reduce  irritation  and  not significantly  alter  the  transdermal  absorption  of testosterone.  Many  OTC  ointments  will  significantly reduce the penetration of testosterone when applied to the skin before use, and should be avoided.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark424">To treat androgen insufficiency, the prescribing guidelines for Androderm® recommend two 2.5 mg patches or one 5 mg patch per day. Morning serum testosterone levels are later measured, at which point the physician may adjust upwards or downwards if necessary. For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, higher doses would be necessary  to  achieve  supraphysiological  levels  of testosterone.This would require at least three or four 5 mg or eight 2.5 mg patches per day, delivering approximately 15-20 mg of testosterone.This level is sufficient for most users to notice gains in muscle size and strength, although this is not a very realistic idea in a practical sense. Lower doses may be used, but typically when accompanied by other  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  Testosterone  is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Androderm® is not FDA approved for use in women.

It was originally released in 2.5 gram and 5-gram sachets, equating to a total per-application testosterone dose of 25 mg and 50 mg respectively. The AndroGel® prescribing information states that the product has a transdermal bioavailability of approximately 10%. This means  that  each  2.5  or  5  gram  dose  will  deliver approximately 2.5 mg or 5 mg of hormone systemically. With this mode of administration, testosterone levels begin to elevate approximately 30 minutes after the gel is applied to the body, and substantial elevations in serum androgen levels are achieved within 4 hours. Testosterone levels will remain elevated for approximately 24 hours after administration, so that that the drug is applied once per day. Regular dosing will provide a steady hormone balance over each 24-hour period.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark428">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">AndroGel® was developed in the United States by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, a division of Solvay. It was approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug in February of 2000. It is indicated for use in adult males with conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.  This  includes  cases  of  primary hypogonadism, which may be caused by cryptorchidism, bilateral  torsion,  orchitis,  vanishing  testis  syndrome, orchiectomy,  Klinefelter&#39;s  syndrome,  chemotherapy,  or alcohol/heavy metal toxicity. It is also prescribed to treat hypogonadotrophic  hypogonadism,  including  patients with luteinizing hormone or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency caused by tumors, injury, or radiation. Primary hypogonadism is usually characterized by low testosterone and high gonadotropin (LH/FSH) levels, while hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is usually associated with low testosterone and low to normal gonadotropin levels. AndroGel® is said to have a clinical success rate of 87%, perhaps owing to the greater patient</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_143.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">comfort and compliance this form of testosterone offers in comparison with hormone injections.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Other transdermal testosterone hydroalcoholic gels have been released in the U.S.and abroad since the introduction of AndroGel®. Testim® by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals is perhaps  the  most  well-known  competing  brand,  sold widely in the U.S.and Europe.This product also comes in the form of a 1 % testosterone gel claiming a 10% level of bioavailability. Studies have demonstrated that Testim® delivers as much as 38% more free testosterone for a given dose compared to AndroGel®, however.<span class="s33">1 </span>Testim® is noted to use a thicker and stickier gel compared to AndroGel®, which may explain the greater transfer of hormone. In January  2006,  the  FDA  approved  the  first  generic testosterone  gel  in  the  U.S.,  made  by  Watson Pharmaceuticals. Testosterone gels are one of the most popular  methods  of  testosterone  delivery  in  clinical medicine at the present time, and are likely to be soon found in every market globally that supports an active hormone replacement therapy industry.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark429">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hydroalcoholic transdermal testosterone gels are available in many human drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but usually contain 1% testosterone by weight; packaged in volume tubes or single-dose packets containing 2.5 grams or 5 grams of gel. AndroGel® (U.S.) is also produced in a pump dispenser containing 75 grams of gel, which delivers 60 metered applications of 1.25 grams each.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark430">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">AndroGel® is a hydroalcoholic gel containing 1% of testosterone (free) by weight. It is designed to provide a continuous transdermal delivery of testosterone for 24 hours following application to the skin.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic  steroid.  Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  will increase the likelihood of estrogenic side effects. In such cases, an anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen  citrate  is  commonly  applied  to  prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark432">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Exceeding normal therapeutic doses is likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Women are warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen  such  as  testosterone.  These  may  include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark433">dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark434">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and  myocardial  infarction.  Therapeutic  doses  of testosterone  used  to  correct  insufficient  androgen production in otherwise healthy aging men are unlikely to increase atherogenic risk, and may actually reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality.<span class="s33">3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark435">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Patients should be careful about transferring testosterone to their female partner(s). The prescribing information for AndroGel® suggests that patients wash their hands immediately with soap and water after application, and also recommends covering the application site(s) with clothing after the gel has dried. Studies with AndroGel® have demonstrated that female partners of male patients noticed as much as a doubling of serum testosterone levels following 15 minutes of rigorous skin-on-skin contact.This contact was initiated  between  2  and  12  hours  after  drug administration.  Testosterone  transfer  was  completely avoided when the male subjects wore a shirt.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark437">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">To treat androgen insufficiency, the prescribing guidelines for AndroGel® recommend initiating therapy with a 5g daily dose (delivering 5 mg of testosterone systemically). Serum testosterone levels are measured after 14 days, at which point the physician may adjust upwards to 7.5g or 10g  if  necessary.  For  physique-  or  performance­ enhancing purposes, higher doses would be necessary to achieve supraphysiological levels of testosterone. The most common dose here is 20 grams per day, which delivers approximately 20 mg of testosterone.This level is sufficient for most users to notice significant gains in muscle size and strength. Lower doses are also regularly used by some athletes, but typically when accompanied by other anabolic/androgenic steroids. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired</p><p class="s66" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s65">1  </span>Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profiles <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">of the </span>new testosterone topical gel formulation,Testim, compared to AndroGel.

Given the close similarity of these two compounds, one would expect the release duration of testosterone CHP to be very similar to that of testosterone cypionate, perhaps only slightly longer lasting in effect given the greater size/carbon content of the ester. As a testosterone drug, testosterone CHP is capable of imparting rapid gains in muscle size and strength.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark443">Testosterone  cyclohexylpropionate  was  first  released commercially during the mid-1970&#39;s. It was sold mainly in Europe, under such brand names as Femalon 25, Andromar Retard, and Testosterone Retard Theramex.The Theramex product was the longest lasting of the group, and was sold for approximately 17 years on the French drug market (1974-1991).  </a><span style=" color: #393939;">It  </span>contained  a  steroid  concentration  of 296mg/mL, 148mg/mL, or 37mg/mL in a 1 mL ampule, which equates to 200 mg, 100 mg, or 25 mg of active testosterone, respectively. The 296mg/mL version was the most popular one located on the black market, for obvious reasons. Today, testosterone cyclohexylpropionate is no longer available. No residual stock of the Theramex product is left in commerce at this time, and all other commercial brands were removed from market years before the Theramex brand.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  cyclohexylpropionate  is  no  longer commercially  available.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark445">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) of testosterone cypionate more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark446">help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark447">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark448">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or domiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark449">also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Among bodybuilders, &quot;suspension&quot; is known to be an extremely potent mass agent. It is often said to be the most powerful injectable steroid available, producing very rapid gains in muscle mass and strength.This is largely due to the very fast action of the drug. When using a slow-acting oil­ based steroid like Sustanon® 250, it can take weeks before a peak testosterone level is reached. With suspension, it is just a matter of hours.Thls will usually result in the athlete starting to notice size and strength gains by the end of the first week. By the time the athlete is 30 days into a cycle of suspension, the length it will usually take for Sustanon® 250 to really begin working consistently, the mass gains are already (generally) very extreme.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark454">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  suspension  is  one  of  the  oldest anabolic/androgenic steroids, dating all the way back <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>the 1930&#39;s.Used generically to describe any injectable form of free testosterone, testosterone suspension predates the development of slow-acting (depot) injections of esterified testosterone by several years. Even after the development of esterified derivates, testosterone suspension remained on the U.S. and other select drug markets. For example, testosterone propionate and testosterone enanthate were both commercially available by the 1950&#39;s, yet testosterone suspension remained a regularly produced item in the U.S. for decades more.

With women, the drug was commonly prescribed for the treatment of excessive or painful lactation following childbirth, as well as inoperable mammary cancer. By the 1990&#39;s, however, the FDA had refined the approved uses for testosterone suspension slightly, which began to focus more  tightly  on  the  treatment  of  male  androgen insufficiency. The drug may, however, still be used as a secondary therapy in inoperable breast cancer, although its high tendency to produce virilization makes it an uncommon choice.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark455">Although the number of products containing testosterone suspension steadily dwindled over the years, the drug enjoyed uninterrupted availability on the U.S. prescription drug market all the way up to 1998.That year, the FDA had taken action against Steris Laboratories (a subsidiary of Henry Schein), which at the time was the principal U.S. supplier for testosterone products (manufacturing them for their label and several other brands).The firm was also the last remaining producer of testosterone suspension. The dispute arose over Steris&#39; inventory reports for their Class III drugs. The FDA forced the company to suspend production  of  all  C-lll  pharmaceuticals  until  certain &quot;discrepancies&quot; could be addressed. Years later, Steris was able to resume producing testosterone drugs again, but by this time had made the decision not to resume making testosterone   suspension.   Currently,   testosterone suspension is still available in the U.S., but only through private compounding pharmacies, which may produce the drug on special order from a licensed doctor.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone suspension is available in select human and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but usually contain 50</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">mg/ml or 100 mg/ml of steroid mixed in a water-based solution. Testosterone has low water solubility, so the steroid  will  noticeably  separate  from  a  water-based solution when a vial or ampule is left to sit. A quick shake will temporarily place the drug back into suspension, so that the withdrawn dosage should always be consistent.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark456">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone suspension contains (free) testosterone in a water-based suspension, although oils are sometime also used as carriers. Without esterification, testosterone has a short half-life in the body. Testosterone suspension may require a minimum of 2-3 injections per week to maintain consistent hormone elevations. When calculating dose, especially  when  moving  from  one  testosterone preparation to another, it is also important to remember that  testosterone  suspension  contains  more  active testosterone per milligram than its esterified derivatives. For example, when the weight of the ester is taken into account, 100 mg of testosterone enanthate actually only provides 72mg of raw testosterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark457">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark458">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandroione  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark459">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark460">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">liver, </span>which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">In </span>one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(25%) </span>decrease was <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">seen.</span><span class="s50">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">13% </span>decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">%.</span><span class="s50">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is  </span>added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark461">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">in </span>doses sufficient to promote muscle gain are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark462">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Depending on the size of the particles and other agents present, injections of testosterone suspension may result in local irritation,  pain,  and  redness.  Veterinary  testosterone suspensions may use large particles that require a needle as large as 21 gauge for injection, for example, and can be very  uncomfortable  to  use.  Modern  testosterone suspension preparations made for human use often contain microcrystalline steroid particles. These crystals are highly refined, and are too small to see with the naked eye.  This  design  provides  significantly  more  patient comfort than less refined products, and is generally well tolerated.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To treat androgen insufficiency, the prescribing guidelines for testosterone suspension recommend a dose of 25-50 mg, which is given 2-3 times per week. When used for muscle-building  purposes,  testosterone  suspension  is often administered at a dose of 100-200 mg per injection, which is given every 2nd or 3rd day. Athletes looking to achieve an extremely rapid bulk gain will inject as much as</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">100 mg daily. In most cases this higher dose can be amazing, the user seeming to just inflate with bloated muscle mass in a very short period of time. Back when they were being manufactured, the U.S. 30 mL vials (100 mg/mL) were always the most sought after for this procedure, as each would run the cycle for about a month. Although this drug does require a frequent injection scheduler well-refined suspension should pass through a needle as fine as 27 gauge (insulin). This allows the user more available injection sites, hitting the smaller muscle groups such as the deltoid, triceps, and calves.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">Those looking for only a potent mass agent are often extremely  happy  with  the  results  provided  by</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">testosterone suspension; this product certainly has a strong reputation for performing. But those athletes who want not just quantity but quality are likely to be disappointed, as the muscle mass gain is not going to be a hard, dense one. In fact, the user will often have to contend with excessive fat and water-weight gains when building their physique with this drug, and will often seek the benefit of cutting agents soon afterwards to clean up the look of muscularity. Alternately, one could make use of a smaller dosage of testosterone suspension, which would allow for less estrogen buildup. In such a scenario, one could stack it with any of a variety of other less or non- aromatizable steroids, depending on the desired goals.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark464">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark465">Testosterone suspension </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is </span>rarely used with women in clinical medicine.

This compound uses an unusual chemical group to extend the biological activity of testosterone, namely nicotinic acid. Nicotinic acid is also known as niacin, a well-known vitamin of the B complex family. Niacin is occasionally used as an ester with other medications to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of a delivered  agent,  although  little  is  known  about  its application with an injectable androgenic steroid. As an injectable  testosterone,  it  is  certain,  however,  that testosterone nicotinate is an effective mass- and strength- building drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Testosterone nicotinate was originally developed in the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S. in 1962, but is most known as a commercial drug product by Lannacher Heilmittel GmbH in Austria. It was sold to the Austrian drug market during the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s under the brand name of Bolfortan. <span style=" color: #393939;">No </span>other brands of this drug were known to exist worldwide, making this a very rare form of testosterone. As a result, a great deal of mystique  had  come  to  surround  this  steroid.  Many American bodybuilders came to identify Bolfortan as an agent utilized only by certain circles of elite European athletes, and attributed an unusually high level of anabolic potency to this compound. In reality, however, this was simply  one  of  many  different  injectable  esters  of testosterone, with similar relatively anabolic potency as other  testosterone  drugs.  Testosterone  nicotinate ultimately had a short life on the Austrian drug market,and was all but a myth by the time the early steroid-era of 1980&#39;s and 90&#39;s was in full swing.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark467">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  nicotinate  is  no  longer  commercially available.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark470">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark471">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark472">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the  impact  on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

This  agent  is  specifically  7,17- dimethylated nandrolone, significantly more potent as an anabolic and androgenic agent than its non-methylated parent. Over the years, mibolerone has earned a reputation among  bodybuilders  as  being  one  of  the  strongest steroids ever made.This is correct in a technical sense, as it is one of only a select few commercial steroid products effective in microgram, not milligram, amounts. During standard animal assays, mibolerone was determined to have 41 times the anabolic activity of methyltestosterone when given orally. In contrast, it had only 18 times the androgenic activity. Although both properties are strongly pronounced with this agent, it retains a primarily anabolic character  (in  a  relative  sense).  Estrogenic  and progestational properties are also very pronounced with this drug, however. Among athletes it is most commonly applied during bulking phases of training, or to stimulate aggression before a workout or competition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark480">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mibolerone was first described in 1963.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a veterinary medicine during the 1960&#39;s by Upjohn, which sold the drug under the brand name Cheque Drops. The preparation contained 100 mcg/ml of steroid in a 55 mL bottle, for a total steroid content of 5.5 milligrams (illustrating  the  high  relative  potency  of  mibolerone). Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn later also sold a preparation called Cheque Medicated Dog Food, of obvious composition.The drug was administered orally, and had been used to interrupt the estrous cycle of female dogs, preventing them from going into heat. It is approved for use in an animal for no longer than 24 months. Use of the drug is considered carefully by most veterinarians, mainly because longer-term administration can produce side effects such as clitoral enlargement, aggression, urinary difficulties, and liver damage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_164.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark481">Among athletes, mibolerone has always been seen with a high level of mystique, perhaps partly due to its limited availability. Those actually familiar with the Upjohn (then Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn) product were likely disappointed during the early 2000’s, when the Cheque products were officially discontinued by the manufacturer. The company, now Pfizer Animal Health, presently lists no mibolerone- containing products on its inventory, despite retaining the rights to market the drug. Mibolerone is still available in the U.S., but only in generic form from a private compounding pharmacy, obtained under special order by a licensed veterinarian. The removal of the Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn products from the U.S. market marked the commercial end of mibolerone. No prescription preparation, human or veterinary,  is  currently  known  to  contain  mibolerone worldwide.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark482">Mibolerone is no longer available as a prescription drug product.

At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build,To avoid strong estrogenic side effects, it may be necessary to use an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®.  One  may alternately  use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective  remedy  for  estrogen  control.  Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark484">It is of note that mibolerone also displays strong activity as a progestin in the body.The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins without excessive estrogen levels being present.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by mibolerone.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark485">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss.  Individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of this steroid may find a milder anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin®  to  be  more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids.

This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">function and overall health. Intake of c17-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature in which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods. Note that U.S. prescribing information for Cheque Drops mentions only one human study being conducted on mibolerone, and that  the  study  was  terminated  early  due  to  high hepatotoxicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark486">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.

Although steroidal in structure, danazol is technically classified as an anti-gonadotropin agent. This means that its main function is to suppress LH and FSH, which may also suppress  the  body&#39;s  release  of  sex  hormones  like testosterone and estrogen. Danazol is used clinically to treat  certain  hormone-related  disorders,  not  to  build muscle.lt appears to have little if any anabolic effect, and at best slight androgenic activity. It is also described as being non-estrogenic and non-progestational. This drug is not widely used by athletes, offering little tangible benefits in spite of its structural similarity to other steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Danazol first appeared on the U.S. prescription drug market in the mid-1970&#39;s. It was initially indicated for the treatment  of  endometriosis  amenable  to  hormonal management, and only in those patients who failed to respond, or could not take, other drugs. Danazol works by inhibiting the output of LH and FSH, which in turn may cause normal and ectopic endometrial tissue to become inactive, producing atrophy and regression. More modern applications for the drug include endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, and hereditary angioedema. Due to that fact that its main activity is that of an anti-gonadotropic agent, and not as an anabolic steroid, it was deemed there would be little chance for abuse with this drug. It was likewise never registered as a controlled substance in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Athletes rarely use danazol, mainly because it has little to nothing to offer. Some steroid reference materials have recommended its use to combat the feminization caused by other aromatizable steroids. It is assumed that its androgenic  activity  will  be  enough  to  counter  this, however, it excludes the fact that this drug remains a fairly weak androgen. The fact remains that anti-estrogens are</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_170.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">fundamentally more appropriate for such situations. In their absence, one could find a number of more effective options before trying danazol. Today, most athletes pay absolutely no attention to this drug, so it is rarely encountered. Many newer medications have taken a good deal of the market share away from danazol in recent years as well, although there are also many situations in which this drug is still appropriate to prescribe. It remains available in the U.S. and many markets abroad.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Danazol is available in a variety of human drug markets.

Nandrolone is very similar to testosterone in structure, although it lacks a carbon atom at  the  19th  position  (hence  its  other  name,  19- nortestosterone). Like testosterone, nandrolone exhibits relatively strong anabolic properties. Unlike testosterone, however, its tissue-building activity is accompanied by weak androgenic properties. Much of this has to do with the  reduction  of  nandrolone  to  a  weaker  steroid, dihydronandrolone,  in  the  same  androgen-responsive target tissues that potentate the action of testosterone (by converting it to DHTj.The mild properties of nandrolone decanoate  have  made  it  one  of  the  most  popular injectable steroids worldwide, highly favored by athletes for its ability to promote significant strength and lean muscle  mass  gains  without  strong  androgenic  or estrogenic side effects.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone decanoate was first described in I960,<span class="s33">1 </span>and became  a  prescription  medication  in  1962.  It  <span style=" color: #393939;">was </span>developed  by  the  international  pharmaceuticals  giant Organon, and sold under the brand name Deca-Durabolin. The  name  Deca-Durabolin  denotes  that  the  product contains  a  variant  of  Organon&#39;s  previously  popular nandrolone   injectable   Durabolin   (nandrolone phenylpropionate) using an ester of 10 carbon atoms. Organon expanded the market for nandrolone decanoate very rapidly following its release. Probably owing to a combination of its favorable properties and the large market  presence  of  Organon,  Deca-Durabolin  soon became one of the most widely distributed anabolic steroids in the world.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When first introduced to the United States, nandrolone decanoate (like Durabolin) was prescribed for a variety of</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">ailments.  Listed  indications  included  pre-  and postoperative use for building lean mass, osteoporosis, advanced breast cancer, weight loss due to convalescence or disease, geriatric states (general weakness and frailty), burns, severe trauma, ulcers, adjunct therapy with certain forms of anemia, and selective cases of growth and development retardation in children.The drug was initially sold in a dosage of only 50 mg/ml, owing to the very low recommended doses (usually 50-100 mg every 3-4 weeks). The drug was soon updated to include a 100 mg/ml version, reflecting the need for higher doses in some situations, particularly those with refractory anemia and advanced breast cancer. Later, a 200 mg/ml product was released by Organon as well.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although the drug had been applied favorably for a great many medical uses for approximately a decade, by the mid- 1970&#39;s the indicated uses for nandrolone decanoate were being refined, both in the U.S. and abroad. FDA approved prescribing  information  from  1975  lists  nandrolone decanoate as &quot;probably effective&quot; as adjunct therapy in senile and postmenopausal osteoporosis, as well as for treating  pituitary-deficient  dwarfism  until  growth hormone is more available. It was also deemed &quot;possibly effective&quot; in aiding the retention of lean mass, controlling advanced breast cancer, and as adjunctive therapy for certain  types  of  anemia.  More  time  was  given  to investigate the potential &quot;less than effective&quot; uses of the drug.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark498">The  Deca-Durabolin  brand  of  nandrolone  decanoate remains in limited production today.

Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly  from  the  area  of  injection.  Once  in  the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandroione. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the   window   of   therapeutic   effect   following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nandroione decanoate provides a sharp spike in nandroione  release  24-48  hours  following  deep intramuscular injection, which steadily declines to near baseline levels approximately two weeks later.The half-life of nandroione decanoate is 7-12 days.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="311" height="161" alt="image" src="img/Image_174.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s168">5  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandroione.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark502">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandroione is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to interfering with  libido in males when used without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).<span class="s33">6  7  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects in healthy subjects.

Studies administering <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>00 mg per week of nandrolone decanoate for 6 weeks have demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy. At a dosage of 300 mg per week, this reduction reached 7O%.<span class="s33">10 </span>It is believed that the progestational activity of nandrolone notably contributes to the suppression of testosterone synthesis during therapy, which can be marked  in  spite  of  a  low  tendency  for  estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">11  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone- stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession. Note that prolonged   hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can develop  secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">8 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone cypionate.<span class="s33">9  </span>Nandrolone decanoate should still have a significantly weaker impact on serum lipids than c-17 alpha alkylated agents.

The usual dosage for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes is the range of 200-600 mg per week, taken in cycles 8 to 12 weeks in length.This level is sufficient for most users to notice measurable gains in lean muscle mass and strength. It is often stated that nandrolone decanoate will exhibit its optimal effect (best  gain/side  effect  ratio)  at  2mg  per  pound  of bodyweight/weekly,  although  individual  differences  in response  will  likely  dictate  varying  ideal  doses  for different users. Deca is not known as a very &quot;fast&quot; builder. The muscle-building effect of this drug is quite noticeable, but not dramatic. In general, one can expect to gain muscle weight at about half the rate of that with an equal amount of testosterone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone decanoate is often combined with other steroids for an enhanced effect. A combination of 200-400 mg/week of nandrolone decanoate and 10-20 mg daily of Winstrol®, for example, is noted to greatly enhance the lookof muscularity and definition when dieting/cutting.A strong  non-aromatizing  androgen  like  Halotestin®  or trenbolone  could  also  be used,  again providing  an enhanced level of hardness and density to the muscles. Being a moderately strong muscle builder, nandrolone</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark506">can also be incorporated into bulk cycles with acceptable results.The classic &quot;Deca and D-bol&quot; stack (usually 200-400 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week and 15-25 mg of Dianabol per day) has been a bodybuilding basic for decades, and always seems to provide excellent muscle growth. A stronger androgen such as Anadrol 50® or testosterone could also be substituted, producing greater results, but with more water retention.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">For general anabolic effects, early prescribing guidelines recommend a dosage of 50-100 mg every 3-4 weeks for 12 weeks.To treat renal anemia, the prescribing guidelines for nandrolone decanoate recommend a dosage of 50­</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark507">100  mg  per  week.

The drug is presently unavailable in the United States. Many Western nations  continue  to  market  the  drug,  though  its production is increasingly being shifted to less regulated markets.  Legitimate  pharmaceutical  forms  are  highly sought after on the black market, and thus subject to a great deal of counterfeiting. In reviewing some of the more  popular  products  and  changes  on  the  global pharmaceutical market, we have made the following observations.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In November 2009, Organon was acquired by Merck/MSD. All Organon Deca-Durabolin products have transitioned over to the MSD label. Avoid any product bearing the Organon  name.  Deca-Durabolin  remains  the  most popular  brand  of  nandrolone  decanoate  worldwide, though is noticing declining distribution in recent years.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Brand name Deca-Durabolin is no longer available in the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">United States.

Any versions found on the black market should be considered counterfeit.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In Greece, the brands Deca-Durabolin from MSD and Anaboline from Adelco remain popular, and do not appear the subject of widespread counterfeiting as of yet. However, both are available in a 50 mg/mL dosage only. As with all Greek drugs, the pharmaceutical ID sticker should show a hidden mark under UV light.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Decabolic from Asia Pharma (Malaysia) is fairly popular on the black market.

Following deep intramuscular injection, the drug is designed to provide a sustained release  of  testosterone  into  the  bloodstream  for approximately 2 to 3 weeks. In order to maintain normal physiological  levels  of  testosterone  during  androgen replacement  therapies,  injections  of  testosterone enanthate are usually required at least every two weeks, although more meticulous physicians will administer the drug  weekly.  As  with  all  testosterone  injectables, testosterone enanthate is highly favored by athletes for its ability to promote strong increases in muscle mass and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark510">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone enanthate first appeared on Western drug markets during the early 1950&#39;s. It was the first slow-acting oil-based injectable ester of testosterone to be widely adopted in Western medicine, and effectively replaced testosterone propionate and testosterone suspension for most therapeutic uses. The first brand of this drug to be sold in the U.S. was Delatestryl® by Squibb. Over the years, the Delatestryl® brand has changed hands several times. It is presently owned by Endo Pharmaceuticals. The most prominent brand of testosterone enanthate outside of the United States is Testoviron®, a drug that has seen uninterrupted production for more than 50 years.

This may manifest itself with a loss of libido, lean muscle mass, and normal energy and vigor.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.  The  half-life  of  testosterone  enanthate  is approximately eight days after injection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="312" height="180" alt="image" src="img/Image_176.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Secondary analysis should be performed with Substance Test B, which should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) dark brown color change.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark515">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark516">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark517">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">(25%) </span>decrease was seen.<span class="s168">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">13% </span>decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">%.</span><span class="s33">4  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s168">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark518">day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As with all anabolic/androgenic steroids, it is unlikely that one will retain every pound of new bodyweight after a cycle  is  concluded.  This  is  especially  true  when withdrawing from a strong (aromatizing) androgen like testosterone, as much of the new weight gain is likely to be in the form of water retention; quickly eliminated after drug  discontinuance.  An  imbalance  of  anabolic  and catabolic hormones during the post-cycle recovery period may further create an environment that is unfavorable for the retention of muscle tissue. Proper ancillary drug therapy is usually recommended to help restore hormonal balance more quickly, ultimately helping the user retain more muscle tissue.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark519">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Although active in the body for a longer time, testosterone enanthate is usually injected on a weekly basis for muscle-building purposes. The usual dosage  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes is in the range of 200-600 mg per week, taken in cycles 6 to 12 weeks in length. This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is usually incorporated into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than  definition.  Some  do  incorporate  the  drug  into cutting cycles as well, but typically in lower doses (100- 200 mg per week) and/or when accompanied by an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark520">aromatase inhibitor to keep estrogen levels under control. Testosterone enanthate is a very effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. Some, however, find a need to stack it with other anabolic/androgenic steroids for a stronger effect, in which case an additional 200-400  mg  per  week  of  boldenone  undecylenate, methenolone  enanthate,  or  nandrolone  decanoate should provide substantial results with no significant hepatotoxicity. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and   can   be   combined   with   many   other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark521">Testosterone enanthate is rarely used with women in clinical medicine. When applied, it is most often used as a secondary medication during inoperable breast cancer, when other therapies have failed to produce a desirable effect and suppression of ovarian function is necessary. Testosterone enanthate is not recommended for women for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes due to its  strong  androgenic  nature,  tendency  to  produce virilizing  side  effects,  and  slow-acting  characteristics (making blood levels difficult to control).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  enanthate  remains  the  most  widely manufactured form of injectable testosterone worldwide.

Testosterone is also the principle anabolic hormone in men, and is the basis   of   comparison   by   which   all   other anabolic/androgenic  steroids  are  judged.  As  with  all testosterone injectables, testosterone cypionate is highly favored by athletes for its ability to promote strong increases in muscle mass and strength. It is interesting to note  that  while  a  large  number  of  other  steroidal compounds have been made available since testosterone injectables, they are still considered to be the dominant bulking  agents  among  bodybuilders.  There  is  little argument that these are among the most powerful mass drugs available, testosterone cypionate included.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark523">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone cypionate first appeared on the U.S. drug market during the mid-1950&#39;s under the brand name of Depo-Testosterone cyclopentylpropionate (soon abridged to simply Depo-Testosterone). it was developed by the pharmaceutical giant Upjohn, and is still sold to this day by the same company under the same trade name (although now they are called Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn). This is a drug with limited global availability, and has historically been (largely) identified as an American item.lt is not surprising that American athletes have long favored this form of testosterone over testosterone enanthate, the dominant slow-acting ester of testosterone on the global market.This preference,  however,  is  likely  rooted  in  history  and availability, not actual therapeutic advantages.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  cypionate  and  testosterone  enanthate provide extremely comparable patterns of testosterone release. Not only are physical advantages not possible in one  over  the  other,  but  actual  differences  in pharmacokinetic patterns are hard to notice (these two drugs  are  for  all  intents  and  purposes  functionally interchangeable).The only key difference between the two</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:27pt"><td style="width:244pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" colspan="2" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">Chemical Names    <span class="s24">4-androsten-3-one-17beta-ol</span></p><p class="s24" style="padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">17beta-hydroxy-androst-4-en-3-one</p></td></tr><tr style="height:15pt"><td style="width:111pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Estrogenic Activity</p></td><td style="width:133pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">moderate</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:111pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#FBFBFB"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Progestational Activity</p></td><td style="width:133pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s24" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-right: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">low</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">seems to be in the area of patient comfort. Cypionic acid is less irritating at the site of injection than enanthoic acid (enanthate) for a small percentage of patients.This makes testosterone cypionate a more favorable choice for those with  recurring  issues  of  injection-site  pain  with testosterone  enanthate.  This  difference  likely  had something to do with the early development of this testosterone ester as a commercial drug product,</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The  main  use  of  testosterone  cypionate  in  clinical medicine  has  historically  been  the  treatment  of  low androgen  levels  in  males,  although  many  other applications have existed for this drug as well. During the 1960&#39;s,   for   example,   the   drug&#39;s   prescribing recommendations called for such uses as supporting bone structure maturity, treating menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding)  and  excessive  lactation  in  females,  and increasing muscle mass and combating osteoporosis in the elderly. It was also being recommended for increasing male fertility,  whereby  induced  testosterone/spermatogenesis suppression  (caused  by  administering  200  mg  of testosterone cypionate per week for 6 to 10 weeks) was potentially  followed  by  a  period  of  rebound spermatogenesis (due to temporarily higher than normal gonadotropin levels).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">By the 1970&#39;s, the FDA had been granted much stronger control over the prescription drug market, and the broad uses in which testosterone cypionate was first indicated were  now  being  refined.  For  example,  &quot;testosterone rebound therapy&quot; as a way to increase male fertility was proving to be unreliable, especially in the face of newer more effective medications, and was soon eliminated from prescribing guidelines. So too was the recommendation for its use to treat things like excessive menstrual bleeding and lactation. In general, testosterone therapy was being pulled back to focus mainly on male androgen deficiency, and less on other applications, especially when involving populations more susceptible to androgenic side effects, such as women and the elderly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark524">Today, testosterone cypionate remains readily available on the U.S. prescription drug market, where it is FDA- approved for hormone replacement therapy in men with conditions associated with a deficiency of endogenous testosterone, and as a secondary treatment for inoperable metastatic breast cancer in women (although it is not widely used for this purpose anymore). Testosterone cypionate is currently available outside of the United States, but not widely. Known international sources for the drug include Canada, Australia, Spain, Brazil, and South Africa.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark525">Testosterone cypionate is available in select human and veterinary drug markets.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. The half-life of testosterone cypionate is approximately 8 days after injection.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Pharmacokinetics of Testosterone Cypionate Injection</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="141" alt="image" src="img/Image_178.gif"/></span></p><p class="s184" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Day</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">Figure 1.

Secondary analysis should be performed with Substance Test B, which should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) orange-brown color change.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark527">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) of testosterone cypionate more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone cypionate, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark528">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandroione  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark529">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark530">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should <span style=" color: #393939;">be taken </span>into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  <span style=" color: #393939;">added  </span>to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark531">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">As with all anabolic/androgenic steroids, it is unlikely that one will retain every pound of new bodyweight after a cycle  is  concluded.  This  is  especially  true  when</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">withdrawing from a strong (aromatizing) androgen like testosterone cypionate, as much of the new weight gain is likely to be in the form of water retention, quickly eliminated after drug discontinuance. An imbalance of anabolic and catabolic hormones during the post-cycle recovery period may further create an environment that is unfavorable for the retention of muscle tissue. Proper ancillary drug therapy is usually recommended to help restore  hormonal  balance  more  quickly,  ultimately helping the user retain more muscle tissue.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Another way to lessen the post-cycle &quot;crash&quot; is to first replace testosterone cypionate with a milder anabolic such  as  nandrolone  decanoate  or  methenolone enanthate.The new steroid would be administered alone for one to two more months, at a dosage of 200-400 mg per week. In this &quot;stepping down&quot; procedure the user is attempting to eliminate the watery bulk of a testosterone- based drug while simultaneously preserving the solid muscularity underneath. This practice can prove to be effective, even if mainly for psychological reasons (some may view it as simply dividing the crash into water and hormonal stages).Testosterone-stimulating drugs are still typically  used  at  the  conclusion  of  therapy,  as endogenous testosterone production will not rebound during the administration of nandrolone decanoate or methenolone enanthate.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">methenolone  enanthate,  or  nandrolone  decanoate should provide substantial results with no significant hepatotoxicity. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and   can   be   combined   with   many   other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark533">While large doses are generally not advised, some bodybuilders have been known to use excessively high dosages of this drug (1,000 mg per week or more). This was  much  more  common  before  the  1990&#39;s,  when cypionate vials were usually very cheap and easy to find. A &quot;more is better&quot; attitude is easy to justify when paying only $20 for a 10cc vial (today the typical price for a single injection). At dosages of 800-1000 mg per week or more, water  retention  will  likely  account  for  more  of  the additional weight gain than new muscle tissue. The practice of &quot;megadosing&quot; is inefficient (not to mention potentially dangerous), especially when we take into account the typical high cost of steroids today.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone cypionate is rarely used with women in clinical medicine.

Although active in the body for a longer time, testosterone cypionate is usually injected on a weekly basis for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.The usual dosage is in the range of 200-600 mg per week, taken in cycles 6 to 12 weeks in length.This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is usually incorporated into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than  definition.  Some  do  incorporate  the  drug  into cutting cycles as well, but typically in lower doses (100- 200 mg per week) and/or when accompanied by an aromatase inhibitor to keep estrogen levels under control. Testosterone cypionate is a very effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. Some, however, find a need to stack it with other anabolic/androgenic steroids for a stronger effect, in which case an additional 200-400  mg  per  week  of  boldenone  undecylenate,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">virilizing side effects, and slow-acting characteristics (making blood levels difficult to control).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark534">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone cypionate remains widely available as a prescription  drug  product.

Esterified  forms  of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection.

Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as domiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark541">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark542">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark543">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows It to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after <i><b>12 </b></i>weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">4  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark544">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Methandrostenolone is a derivative of testosterone, modified so that the hormone&#39;s androgenic (masculinizing) properties are reduced and its anabolic (tissue building) properties preserved. Having a lower level of   relative   androgenicity   than   testosterone, methandrostenolone is classified as an &quot;anabolic&quot; steroid, although quite a distinct androgenic side is still present. This drug was designed, and is principally sold, as an oral medication, although it can also be found in a number of injectable veterinary solutions. Dianabol is today, and has historically  been,  the  most  commonly  used  oral anabolic/androgenic   steroid   for   physique   and performance-enhancing purposes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark549">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">Methandrostenolone was first described in 1955.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was released to the U.S. prescription drug market in 1958, under the brand name Dianabol by Ciba Pharmaceuticals. Ciba developed methandrostenolone into a medicine with the help of Dr. John Ziegler, who was the team physician for a number of U.S. Olympic teams, including weightlifting. Ziegler makes note in Bob Goldman’s Death in the Locker Room that he was first exposed to steroids at the 1956 World Games, seeing that the Russians were heavily abusing testosterone on their strength athletes. According to Ziegler, the hormone was having noticeable side effects, and one athlete had such profound prostate enlargement that he was forced to urinate with the aid of a catheter. While working with Ciba, the company tested a steroid (synthesized  earlier)  that  had  reduced  androgenicity compared  to  testosterone,  but  with  retained  tissue­ building  (anabolic)  properties.  This  had  been accomplished by altering the basic chemical structure of testosterone in a way that altered its metabolism and disposition in the body. With the help of Dr. Ziegler, Ciba</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">brought to market one of the most effective oral &quot;anabolic&quot; steroid medicines ever known, methandrostenolone. The success of the drug was rapid and far-reaching.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dr.  Ziegler&#39;s  athletes  were  quickly  making  great advancements in their competitive careers with the help of the drug. According to reports, Ziegler too seemed to be very impressed, at least for a while.<span class="s33">2 </span>But by the early 1960&#39;s, it was starting to look like Dianabol had sparked a great wave of steroid abuse in competitive sports. Dr. Ziegler&#39;s early recommendations, which depending on the source called for as little as 5 mg per day or as much as 15 mg per day, were being largely ignored,as athletes developed their own more aggressive (and potentially dangerous) dosing strategies. Dr. Ziegler soon became disgusted with the misuse of the drug, and would eventually become a voice of opposition to sports doping. By 1967, approximately 10 years after first introducing Dianabol to his athletes, he had categorically condemned the use of anabolic steroids in sports.<span class="s33">3</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">As early as 1965, Dianabol was already starting to fall under scrutiny of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That year the FDA requested Ciba clarify Dianabol&#39;s medical uses, which were then stated to include helping patients in debilitated states and those with weakened bones. In 1970, the FDA accepted that Dianabol was &quot;Probably Effective&quot; in treating  post-menopausal  osteoporosis  and  pituitary­ deficient dwarfism. These changes were reflected in the drug&#39;s prescribing recommendations during the 1970&#39;$, and Ciba was allowed to continue selling and studying the agent.Ciba eventually lost patent protection, however,and companies like Parr. Barr, Bolar, and Rugby were soon cutting deeply into their market with their own generic version of the drug.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">By the early-80&#39;s the FDA had withdrawn its &quot;Probably Effective&quot; position on the pituitary-deficient dwarfism, and continued  to  press  Ciba  for  more  data.  Sufficient clarification never came, and in 1983 Ciba officially</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark550">withdrew  Dianabol  from  the  U.S.  market.</a><span class="s33">4  </span>Perhaps financial disinterest had a hand in their abandoned push to keep the drug approved. The FDA pulled all generic forms of methandrostenolone from the U.S. market in 1985, a time when most Western nations were also eliminating the drug, finding its existence to be justified mainly by sports doping. Methandrostenolone is still produced  today,  but  typically  in  nations  with  loose prescription drug regulations, and by companies that still prefer to cater to an underground athletic market.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark551">Methandrostenolone is widely available in both human and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may   vary   by   country   and   manufacturer. Methandrostenolone was designed as an oral anabolic steroid containing 2.5 mg or 5 mg of steroid per tablet (Dianabol). Modern brands usually contain 5 mg or 10 mg per tablet. Methandrostenolone can also be found in injectable veterinary preparations. These are typically oil­ based solutions that carry 25 mg/ml of steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark552">Methandrostenolone is a modified form oftestosterone.lt differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the introduction of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, which reduces its relative androgenicity. The resulting steroid also has a much weaker relative binding  affinity  for  the  androgen  receptor  than testosterone, but at the same time displays a much longer half-life and lower affinity for serum-binding proteins in comparison.  These  features  (among  others)  allow methandrostenolone to be a very potent anabolic steroid in spite of a weaker affinity for receptor binding. Recent studies have additionally confirmed that its primary mode of action involves interaction with the cellular androgen receptor.</a><span class="s33">5</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark553">Methandrostenolone can be positively identified with ROIDTESP</a><span class="s33">M </span>Substance Tests A &amp; C.

At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build. Sensitive individuals may therefore want to keep the estrogen under control with the addition of an anti- estrogen such as Nolvadex® and/or Proviron®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective remedy for estrogen control. Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It  is  interesting  to  note  that  methandrostenolone  is structurally identical to boldenone, except that it contains the added c17-alpha-methyl group. This fact makes clear the impact of altering a steroid in such a way, as these two compounds appear to act very differently in the body. A key  dissimilarity  seems  to  lie  in  the  tendency  for estrogenic  side  effects.  Equipoise®  (boldenone undecylenate) is known to be quite mild in this regard, and users commonly take this drug without the need to add an anti-estrogen. Methandrostenolone is much more estrogenic, often necessitating anti-estrogen use. But this difference is not caused by methandrostenolone being more easily aromatized. In fact, the 17-alpha methyl group and  cl-2  double  bond  both  slow  the  process  of aromatization considerably.The issue actually is caused by methandrostenolone    converting    to    17alpha- methylestradiol,  a  more  biologically  active  form  of estrogen than estradiol.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark554">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss.  Individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of methandrostenolone may find a milder anabolic such as Deca-Durabolin® to be more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture,facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While  methandrostenolone  does  convert  to  a  more potent steroid via interaction with the 5-alpha reductase enzyme (the same enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone), it has an extremely low affinity to do so.<span class="s33">7 </span>The androgenic metabolite 5-alpha dihydromethandrostenolone is produced only in trace amounts,   so   the   relative   androgenicity   of methandrostenolone  is  not  significantly  affected  by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark555">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methandrostenolone is a c!7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. Cl 7- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of c17-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Studies  have  shown  that  several  weeks  of methandrostenolone  administration  offers  minimal hepatic stress so long as it is given at a dosage of 10 mg per day or below. At a dose of 15 mg per day, a majority of patients  will  begin  to  demonstrate  disturbed  liver function  as  measured  by  clinically  elevated bromosulphalein retention (a marker of hepatic stress).<span class="s168">8 </span>Even at 2.5 and 5 mg per day, elevations in BSP retention have been reported in patients. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature in which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with methandrostenolone, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark556">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Methandrostenolone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to  liver  breakdown  and  route  of  administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Methandrostenolone is no exception, and is noted for its strong influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Clinical studies giving 15 mg per day to resistance­ training males for 8 weeks caused the mean plasma testosterone  level  to  fall  by  69%.<span class="s168">9  </span>Without  the intervention  of  testosterone-stimulating  substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark557">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).</a><span class="s168">10 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The original prescribing guidelines for Dianabol called for a daily dosage of 5 mg.This was to be administered on an intermittent basis, with the drug taken for no more than 6 consecutive weeks.Thereafter, a break of 2 to 4 weeks was advised before therapy was resumed. For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, the drug is also used intermittently, with cycles usually lasting between 6 and 8 weeks in length followed by 6-8 weeks off. Although a low dose of 5 mg daily may be effective for improving performance,  athletes  typically  take  much  higher amounts. A daily dosage of three to six 5 mg tablets (15-30 mg)  is  most  common,  and  typically  produces  very dramatic results.Some venture even higher in dosage, but this practice usually leads to a more profound incidence of side effects, and is generally discouraged.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dianabol stacks well with a variety of other steroids. It is noted to mix particularly well with the mild anabolic Deca-Durabolin®, for example. Together one can expect exceptional muscle and strength gains, with side effects not much worse than one would expect from Dianabol alone. For sheer mass, a long-acting testosterone ester like enanthate or cypionate can be used. With the high estrogenic/androgenic  properties  of  this  androgen, however, side effects should be more pronounced. Gains would be pronounced as well, which usually makes such an endeavor worthwhile to the user. As discussed earlier, ancillary drugs can be added to reduce the side effects associated with this kind of cycle.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The half-life of Dianabol is only about 3 to 5 hours. A single daily dosage schedule will produce <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>varying blood level, with ups and downs throughout the day. The user, likewise, has a choice, to either split up the tablets during the day or to take them all at one time. The usual recommendation has been to divide them and try to regulate the concentration in your blood. This, however, will produce a lower peak blood level than if the tablets were taken all at once, so there may be a trade-off with this  option.  Both  options  work  fine,  but  anecdotal evidence seems to support single daily doses as being better for overall results. With such a schedule, it seems logical that taking the pills earlier in the day would be optimal. This would allow a considerable number of daytime  hours  for  an  androgen-rich  metabolism  to heighten the uptake of nutrients, especially the critical hours following training.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark559">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Being moderately androgenic, Dianabol is really only a popular steroid with men. When used by women, strong virilization symptoms are possible. Some do experiment with it, however, and often find low doses (2.5-5 mg) of this steroid quite effective for new muscle growth. Studies have demonstrated that a majority of women will notice acne, which is indicative of androgenicity, at a dosage of only 10 mg per day. Children are likely to notice virilizing effects with as little as 2.5 mg per day.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark560">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methandrostenolone  is  declining  in  availability  as  a pharmaceutical product, with its supply largely isolated to less regulated markets in Asia and Eastern Europe.

It is a close cousin of methyltrienolone, differing only by an additional 7-alpha methyl group.This is a modification that only appears a couple of times in commercial steroid medicine, but when it does it seems to have a powerful effect. Its main function is to reduce binding to serum proteins, increasing the percentage of free (active) steroid in the blood and overall steroid potency.  We  see  this  with  bolasterone,  a  powerful dimethylated  derivative  of  testosterone  that  displays nearly  six  times  greater  anabolic  potency  than methyltestosterone.  7-Methylation  also  appears  on Cheque  Drops  (mibolerone),  a  7,17-dimethylated nandrolone with about 41 times the oral anabolic potency of methyltestosterone. Dimethyltrienolone is in the same class as a dimethylated form of trenbolone. It is an extremely potent oral anabolic and androgenic steroid, perhaps far more than any other agent developed before or after.This agent is not widely used by athletes, however, given that it was never produced commercially.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark562">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethyltrienolone was first described in 1967.<span class="s33">1  </span>This agent is one of a great many potent anabolic steroids that has  been  developed  but  never  introduced  into  a commercial  drug market.  As such, it is a research compound only, and there is no human data on it to report. There are, of course, a great many compounds that fit this description that are not included in this reference. What makes this particular steroid stand out from the others is its sheer potency. More to the point, dimethyltrienolone is perhaps the most potent anabolic steroid that has ever been developed and assayed for effect. This agent is very similar  in  structure  to  Metribolone  (methyltrienolone), which was determined to be not only extremely potent, but also the most hepatotoxic steroid ever developed at the time of its testing. That steroid is certainly an agent of extreme proportions, and dimethyltrienolone is only going</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to be a more potent (and potentially more toxic) derivative.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When this steroid was assayed for anabolic and androgenic effect back in 1967, the results were indeterminate. They were indeterminate because the values were so high they could not be accurately calculated given the parameters of the study. The study itself was very typical. As would be expected of an oral steroid, methyltestosterone was used as the standard of comparison. The animals (rats) were dosed and later sacrificed. Ventral prostate and seminal vesicles were weighed to measure androgenic effect, and levator ani was used for anabolic potency (the same three values that were the standard of analysis for steroids in the 1960&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s). In regards to all three measures, dimethyltrienolone was shown to be more than 100 times stronger in effect than methyltestosterone. The numbers, when reported in percentages, simply read &quot;&gt; 10,000&quot; (greater than 10,000%) on all 3 tests. I was unable to find further oral assays on this steroid, making the exact potency (by these experiments or others) unknown.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dimethyltrienolone is not available as a commercial agent.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Dimethyltrienolone is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">2) the introduction of double bonds at carbons 9 and 11, which  increases  its  binding  affinity  and  slows  its metabolism, and 3) the introduction of a methyl group at carbon 7 (alpha), which inhibits steroid attachment to serum-binding proteins like SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) and greatly enhances relative biological activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethyltrienolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not believed to be measurably estrogenic. It is of note, however, that dimethyltrienolone likely displays significant binding affinity for the progesterone receptor. The side</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia    caused    by    progestational anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark563">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still likely with this substance.This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and  clitoral  enlargement.  Additionally,  the  5-alpha reductase   enzyme   does   not   metabolize dimethyltrienolone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark564">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Dimethyltrienolone is a c17-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. 07- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of c17-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Note that dimethyltrienolone is an exceedingly potent oral steroid, with a very high level of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  This  makes dimethyltrienolone exceedingly liver toxic.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark565">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Although not extensively studied in humans, the high relative potency and  non-aromatizable  nature  of  dimethyltrienolone suggests that this agent is extremely prone to negatively altering lipid values and increasing atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark566">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark567">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">2 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark568">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethyltrienolone  was  never  approved  for  use  in humans.

At the very least, routine blood tests should be conducted to ensure the agent is not imparting damage. Drug duration is also usually very limited, typically to 4 weeks of use or less.The relative potency of dimethyltrienolone is extremely high, requiring doses as little as .25 (1/4) milligram per day for a pronounced anabolic effect (.25 to Img likely being the chosen range).

Instead, Dinandrol can be looked at as a form of Deca-Durabolin that has a sharper short­ term spike of nandrolone following each injection, perhaps making it best to inject twice weekly as opposed to once. As with all nandrolone injectables, this preparation is favored by athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to promote moderate to strong gains in lean muscle mass, with minimal estrogenic or androgenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dinandrol is a product of Xelox Pharma Co. in the Philippines. Xelox is a licensed drug company, although most of its steroid products are developed for export sales only. The packaging for Dinandrol lists the indicated uses for the drug as being aplastic anemia, anemia caused <span style=" color: #393939;">by </span>cytotoxic drugs, or anemia caused by chronic renal failure. Owing to the fact that Deca-Durabolin is also approved for use in anemic patients in many markets, this drug could be viewed as a cheaper and often acceptable (although not ideal) therapeutic alternative. Still, it is estimated <span style=" color: #393939;">that </span>the majority  of  steroid  product  that  is  traded  on  the international market is diverted to off-label use by athletes and bodybuilders, usually in Europe and the United States, so it is uncertain how widely this drug is dispensed to legitimate patients. Dinandrol is occasionally smuggled into the United States, though remains more widely distributed on less tightly controlled European markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_186.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark573">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark574">Dinandrol is manufactured by Xelox Pharma in the Philippines.lt contains 100 mg/mL of steroid in oil in a 2 mL vial.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark575">Dinandrol  contains  a  mixture  of  two  nandrolone compounds, which where modified with the addition of carboxylic acid esters (propionic phenyl ester and decanoic acids) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids  are  designed  to  prolong  the  window  of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with testosterone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">2 </span>Consequently, estrogen related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated-estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark576">It is of note that nandroione has some activity as a progestin in the body.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">4  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandroione.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandroione is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandroione  is  prone  to interfering  with  libido  in  males  when  used  without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandroione  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).<span class="s33">5  6  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandroione. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandroione  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandroione  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandroione if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark577">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nandroione is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have hepatotoxic effects.

This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandroione decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">7 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandroione  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">8   </span>Nandroione   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark579">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

This level is sufficient for most users to notice measurable gains in lean muscle mass and strength, which should be accompanied by a low level of estrogenic and androgenic activity. Due to the fast-acting nature of nandrolone phenylpropionate, the total weekly dosage is often divided into two separate applications, spaced several days apart. Note that as a nandrolone injectable, Dinandrol seems to fit well for both bulking and cutting purposes, and can reasonably replace Deca-Durabolin in most cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark581">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark582">To  treat  aplastic  anemia,  prescribing  guidelines recommend a dosage of 50-200 mg per week.

Drive is perhaps the most well-known of these products. Being that it is neither the most concentrated preparation nor the most effective, however, much of its popularity is likely due to its well-coined trade name and early sales history.

Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark591">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

The properties of this drug are strikingly similar to those of Deca-Durabolin® which uses the slower acting drug nandrolone decanoate. The primary difference between these two preparations is the speed in which nandrolone is released into the blood. While  nandrolone  decanoate  provides  a  release  of nandrolone  from  the  area  of  injection  lasting approximately 3 weeks, nandrolone phenylpropionate is active for only about a week. In clinical situations, Deca- Durabolin can thus be injected once every 2 or 3 weeks, while Durabolin® is usually administered every several days to once weekly. Otherwise, the two drugs are virtually interchangeable. Like Deca-Durabolin, Durabolin is valued by athletes and bodybuilders for its abilities to promote strength and lean muscle mass gains without significant estrogenic or androgenic side effects.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone  phenylpropionate  was  first  described  in 1957.<span class="s33">1 </span>It became a prescription medication shortly after, sold by the international pharmaceuticals giant Organon (now Merck/MSD) under the brand name Durabolin. When first introduced to the United States, indicated uses of nandrolone  phenylpropionate  included  pre-  and postoperative lean mass retention, osteoporosis, advanced breast cancer, weight loss due to convalescence or disease, geriatric states (general weakness and frailty), burns, severe trauma, ulcers, adjunct therapy with certain forms of anemia, and selective cases of growth and development retardation in children. During the 1970&#39;s, the FDA began revising the indicated uses of this drug, however, and they were soon significantly narrowed. Moving forward, the drug was mainly being indicated for the treatment of advanced metastatic breast cancer, and as adjunct therapy for  the  treatment  of  senile  and  post-menopausal osteoporosis.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_193.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Durabolin was a key focus of Organon&#39;s marketing efforts only for well less than a decade following its release. Once Deca-Durabolin was introduced during the 1960&#39;s, this shorter-acting counterpart, although still available, started to take a back seat.  Durabolin was not completely abandoned by Organon at the time, however, partly due to the fact that it was given a slightly different set of therapeutic  uses  in  certain  countries,  and  therefore continued to hold onto a niche market for some time. As the size of the anabolic steroid market continued to grow throughout  the  1970&#39;s  and  &#39;80&#39;s,  it  was  nandrolone decanoate that was attracting the most attention of other drug  manufacturers.  Numerous  drug  companies  had produced   their   own   versions   of   nandrolone phenylpropionate over the years, however. The long-term manufacturing plans for Durabolin under the new owner Merck/MSD remain unclear. The product may have been discontinued worldwide, and thus would remain available in generic and off-brand forms only.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark597">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone phenylpropionate is available in select human drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but usually contain <span style=" color: #393939;">25 </span>mg/mL or 50 mg/mL of steroid dissolved in oil.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark598">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone  phenylpropionate  is  a  modified  form  of nandrolone,  where  a carboxylic acid  ester (propionic phenyl ester) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong  the  window  of  therapeutic  effect  following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nandrolone phenylpropionate provides a sharp spike in nandrolone release 24-48 hours following deep</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark599">intramuscular injection, and declines to near baseline levels within a week.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone phenylpropionate (in oil) can be positively identified using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests <span style=" color: #393939;">A </span>&amp; D. The drug should produce a slightly delayed reaction with Substance Test D, turning purple after 2-3 minutes. Secondary analysis should be performed with Substance Test A, which should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) light olive color change.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark600">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with testosterone.<span class="s33">2 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">3 </span>Consequently, estrogen- related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as a progestin in the body.<span class="s33">4 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">5  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of <span style=" color: #393939;">fat </span>storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark601">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to interfering  with  libido  in  males  when  used  without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark602">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).</a><span class="s33">6  7  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably Increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects.

This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">8 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone cypionate.<span class="s33">9 </span>Nandrolone should still have a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">significantly weaker impact on serum lipids than c-17 alpha alkylated agents.

Studies administering  100  mg  injection  of  nandrolone phenylpropionate demonstrated a rapid suppression of serum  testosterone  following  a  single  injection. Testosterone levels declined to approximately 30% of initial level by day 3 after drug administration, and stayed suppressed for approximately 13 days. Regular use is expected  to  significantly  lengthen  the  endogenous hormone  recovery  window.  It  is  believed  that  the progestational activity of nandrolone notably contributes to  the  suppression  of  testosterone  synthesis  during therapy, which can be marked in spite of a low tendency for estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">10  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession.

This  ester  provides  a  pattern  of hormone release virtually identical to that of testosterone cypionate,  with  peak  levels  of  drug  being  noted approximately 24-48 hours after administration, and a substantial hormone release sustained for about weeks. In this case the active hormone is nandrolone, which is a moderately  strong  anabolic  steroid  that  carries  mild estrogenic and androgenic properties. This product is essentially identical in overall effect to Deca-Durabolin® (nandrolone decanoate), producing measurable gains in strength  and  lean  muscle  mass,  which  tend  to  be accompanied by a low level of side effects.The one point of difference is that nandrolone cypionate may appear to be a faster-acting compound to some users. Otherwise, there is no discernable difference between the two compounds, and  nandrolone  cypionate  could  replace  nandrolone decanoate in virtually all cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone cypionate was first developed during the 1960&#39;s. It was sold for a brief time as a human-use pharmaceutical, under such brand names as Anabo, Depo- Nortestonate,  Nortestrionate,  and  Sterocrinolo.  Such preparations did not last, however, and in recent years the drug has been available only as a product of veterinary medicine. The most notable appearance has come from Jurox in Australia, which marketed a 50 mg/mL version of the  drug  called  Dynabol  50.  Jurox  also  included nandrolone cypionate as part of an anabolic steroid blend called  Nandrabolin.  Both  products,  however,  were discontinued in 2001, when Jurox scaled back its steroid line.This was likely done in response to media criticisms of heavy Australian veterinary exports to Mexico, which largely fuel the American black market.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">The discontinued Jurox products were quickly transferred to SYD Group in Australia, assuring they would not be</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_199.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">completely  eliminated  from  commerce.  They  were subsequently reintroduced to market in 2002, under the names Anabolic DN and Anabolic NA, respectively.The new names  made  loose  reference  to  the  former  Jurox trademarks, likely in an effort to retain some of the original market for the products. SYD Group had also introduced a high-dose version of Anabolic DN directly to the Mexican veterinary drug market, but the product has since been withdrawn.  This  time  the  product  was  discontinued following U.S. DEA charges against the firm, alleging that they were conspiring to illegally export Mexican steroids to the U.S.Today, the Anabolic DN and Anabolic NA products remain available on the Australian veterinary drug market, although tight controls limit diversion for off-label use.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark609">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark610">Nandrolone  cypionate  is  available  on  the  Australian veterinary drug markets.

Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window  of  therapeutic  effect  following  administration, allowing for a less-frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nandrolone cypionate provides a sharp spike in nandrolone release 24-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">48 hours following deep intramuscular injection, and sustains  a  substantial  release  of  hormone  for approximately 2 weeks.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark611">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with testosterone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">2 </span>Consequently, estrogen- related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as a progestin in the body.<span class="s33">3 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">4  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark612">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to interfering  with  libido  in  males  when  used  without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark613">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).</a><span class="s33">5  6  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark614">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">7 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">8   </span>Nandrolone   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark615">Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients </a><span style=" color: #393939;">is </span>also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. For sake of comparison, studies administering <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>00 mg per week of nandrolone decanoate for 6 weeks <span style=" color: #393939;">have </span>demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy.

Although  higher  doses  (450-600  mg)  may produce a stronger anabolic effect, given the relatively low concentration in which this drug is found (50 mg/mL), doses above 400 mg are not commonly applied. Instead, the drug is often stacked with another agent, usually an androgen such as an injectable testosterone, which also helps  offset  the  very  low  level  of  androgenicity  of nandrolone.

With  proper  attention  paid  to  carrier, concentration, volume, and pharmacokinetics, it would likely even be possible to formulate this <span style=" color: #393939;">steroid </span>into a very long-acting drug preparation, one similar to testosterone undecanoate (Nebido) in appearance. Even without <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>further  protracted  therapeutic  window,  nandroione undecanoate can be comfortably injected once every 1 to 2 weeks, which reflects its slow-acting nature. Although no longer available, this agent <span style=" color: #393939;">was </span>once highly favored <span style=" color: #393939;">by </span>athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to promote slow steady gains in lean mass with minimal estrogenic or androgenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandroione  undecanoate  was  developed  during  the 1960&#39;s, and was subsequently sold as Dynabolon in Italy (Chrinos) and France (Theramex), and as Psychobolan in Germany (Theramex). The Italian product was moved to the new Farmasister label years later, but retained <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>original Dynabolon trade name. Dynabolon was generally indicated for use in patients suffering from malnutrition, catabolic states, or recovering from major surgery. It was also used to combat osteoporosis, including the treatment of androgen-sensitive populations such as women <span style=" color: #393939;">and </span>the elderly. Nandroione undecanoate seems to <span style=" color: #393939;">have </span>exhibited a fair safety record, yet in spite of this, the three known commercial preparations did not last on their respective prescription drug markets. Psychobolan from <span style=" color: #393939;">Germany </span>and  Dynabolon  from  Farmasister  <span style=" color: #393939;">in  </span>Italy  were discontinued many years ago, and Dynabolon from France finally followed before the close <span style=" color: #393939;">of the </span>1990&#39;s. <span style=" color: #393939;">At </span>present, this is one of the scarcest forms of nandrolone.There is only one known product <span style=" color: #393939;">still </span>remaining <span style=" color: #393939;">from </span>a registered drug company (Asia Pharma).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark621">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandroione undecanoate is no longer available as a prescription drug product. When manufactured, it was supplied at a concentration of 80.5 mg/mL dissolved in oil and sealed in a 1 mL ampule. Each ampule provided the equivalent of 50 mg of nandroione base.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark622">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandroione  undecanoate  is  a  modified  form  of nandroione, where a carboxylic acid ester (undecanoic acid) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandroione. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window  of  therapeutic  effect  following  administration, allowing for a less-frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nandroione undecanoate is designed to provide a slow release of nandroione for up to 3 to 4 weeks following injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark623">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandroione has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with testosterone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandroione to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandroione is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">2 </span>Consequently, estrogen- related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark624">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as a progestin </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">in </span>the body.<span class="s33">3 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">as in </span>19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">19-nor </span>anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">4  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">to </span>those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">hormones here, </span>such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">of </span>progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is </span>often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">oily </span>skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">effects </span>comparably higher than with more androgenic <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">agents </span>such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is  </span>prone  to interfering  with  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">libido  in  </span>males  when  used  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">without </span>another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(DHN).</span><span class="s50">5  6  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nandrolone <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is </span>not <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">c-1</span>7 <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">alpha </span>alkylated, <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">and </span>not known <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">have hepatotoxic effects.

The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">7 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">8   </span>Nandrolone   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark626">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. For sake of comparison, studies administering 100 mg per week of nandrolone decanoate for 6 weeks have demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy. At a dosage of 300 mg per week, this reduction  reached  70%.<span class="s33">9  </span>It  is  believed  that  the progestational activity of nandrolone notably contributes to  the  suppression  of  testosterone  synthesis  during therapy, which can be marked in spite of a low tendency for estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">10  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

A total of 3 to 6 ampules were used for a given 6-week period of therapy. When used for physique-or performance-enhancing purposes, a dose of 3 to 4 ampules (241.5 to 322mg) per week is most common, taken in cycles 8 to 12 weeks in length.This level is sufficient for most users to notice measurable gains in lean  muscle  mass  and  strength,  which  should  be accompanied by a low level of estrogenic and androgenic activity. Higher doses (400-600 mg per week) will impart a stronger anabolic effect, but can be difficult given the relatively  low  concentration  this  steroid  was manufactured in. Instead, many opted to combine this agent  with  other  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  for  a stronger effect. Given its properties, it seems to fit well for both bulking and cutting purposes, and can reasonably replace Deca-Durabolin in such cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark628">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone undecanoate was used clinically at a dose of 1 ampule every 1 to 2 weeks.

It  is  a  close  chemical  cousin  of methyltestosterone, although in spite of this association the agent is far more anabolic than it is androgenic in nature. More specifically, standard laboratory assays show that its anabolic potency exceeds its androgenic by a factor of 7.5. Milligram for milligram it is also about 4.5 times more anabolic than methyltestosterone, while having only about 60% of its androgenic component. Although these values may vary somewhat with humans, in regards to potency   and   anabolic/androgenic   separation, thiomesterone is still very much in the same class as the popular anabolics stanozolol and oxandrolone. This drug, though scarcely used by athletes, especially in modern years, was highly valued for its ability to promote lean gains in muscle size and strength without water retention or significant side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Thiomesterone  was  first  described  in  1964.<span class="s33">1  </span>It  was developed by E. Merck AG, and presented as a medicine at the 16th German Therapy Congress and Pharmaceutical Exhibition.<span class="s33">2 </span>Merck had given the agent the trivial name thiomesterone  (tiomesterone),  and  would  sell  it  in Germany under the trademark name Emdabol.This steroid was designed for oral administration, and was indicated for all  consumptive  illnesses  and  for  cachectic  states. Essentially, it was applied as a general anabolic substance when weight gain (lean body mass) was necessary due to severe illness or debilitation. Merck described the drug to the public for the first time in 1964, stating, &quot;Its anabolic activity is twice that of methyltestosterone. It has an extremely favorable anabolic/androgenic index and is said to exhibit no gestagenic or mineralocorticoid side-effects.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Following  the  release  of  the  drug  in  Germany, thiomesterone  would  be  produced  by  AB  Drago  in Sweden, sold as Protabol. Merck would also sell it for a brief</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="349" height="161" alt="image" src="img/Image_206.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">time in Spain as Vitabonifen Forte, which was a vitamin preparation  that  included  thiomesterone  and  other ingredients. Vitabonifen Forte was used to treat a loss of strength  with  aging,  lean  body  mass  wasting,  and osteoporosis. This preparation also included bromelains, which are concentrated proteolytic enzymes from the pineapple plant used to help aid the digestion of proteins from whole foods. Outside of Europe, the drug was even more scarcely produced.The only preparation of note was Emdabolin, made by Chugai Labs in Tokyo, Japan. All such thiomesterone preparations have since been removed from commerce, however, and the drug is no longer available to athletes as a commercial product.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Thiomesterone was always more whisper than substance in athletic circles. While available, it saw extremely limited use even by European athletes, due to its very limited supply. It has, likewise, gone practically unseen in the United States. Thirty years ago, American bodybuilders were treated only to rumors of thiomesterone, and how this rare and highly coveted steroid was the holy grail of anabolic steroids. Nobody could obtain a cycle to vary its effect, however, which only further fed the myth. Little was known about the compound in the West at the time; even its chemical structure was elusive. Dan Duchaine mentions in his Underground Steroid Handbook II only, &quot;This is the elusive thiomesterone, always written up in the research as the  most  promising,  most  potent  anabolic  with  no androgenic side effects. Let me know if you ever find any.&quot; Few other books even discussed it at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although there has been little real-world feedback on this steroid over the years to make reference of, there is enough known about its pharmacological properties to paint a more complete picture than we had before. As detailed above,  its  anabolic  and  androgenic  properties  were assayed, and were shown to be quite favorable. Studies published in 1966 also showed that thiomesterone was more effective than equal doses of methyltestosterone, methandrostenolone, or methenolone acetate for blocking</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark631">the catabolic actions of corticosteroid treatment on bone mass.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>Still, its effects are consistent with that of other potent anabolic agents, and nothing unusual has been found of note. While thiomesterone may indeed be an effective drug with a low inclination for side effects, it is certainly not the &quot;pure&quot; anabolic agent it was rumored to be thirty years ago. Simply stated, it is a steroid that retains very favorable properties if one is looking for a primarily tissue-building (as opposed to masculinizing) steroid, and would behave in a very similar manner to Anavar (oxandrolone) for most users.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark632">Thiomesterone is no longer available as a prescription agent. When manufactured, it came in the form of an oral tablet.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Thiomesterone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha, which helps protect the hormone during oral administration, and 2) the addition of two thioacetyl groups, one at carbon 1 and the other at carbon 7, which inhibit aromatization and 5-alpha reduction and shift the anabolic to androgenic ratio in favor of the former. Thiomesterone  has  significantly  enhanced  anabolic potency  relative  to  methyltestosterone,  with  reduced androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark633">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Thiomesterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, clostebol instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark634">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture,facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, the 5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize thiomesterone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride. Note that thiomesterone is a steroid with very</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such as testosterone, methandrostenolone, or fluoxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark635">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Thiomesterone is a c17-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health, intake of c17-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark636">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Although not extensively studied in humans, the high relative potency and non-aromatizable nature of thiomesterone suggests that this agent is extremely prone to negatively altering lipid  values  and  increasing  atherogenic  risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils <span style=" color: #393939;">(4 </span>grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark637">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.

Here, one is likely to see measurable lean tissue gains, modest strength  increases,  greater  muscle  definition,  and heightened vascularity. Thiomesterone is a very versatile steroid in general, and should stack well with other mild injectable anabolics like Primobolan or Deca-Durabolin for cutting cycles, or stronger androgens/aromatizable steroids  like  testosterone  or  boldenone  for  bulking phases. The fact that estrogen levels will be kept low makes this agent very favorable when it comes <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>tightening up or contest preparations. Its low androgenic and estrogenic components, however, may put many of this drug&#39;s more sensitive users at risk for incurring a loss of libido and even lethargic side effects. This is often corrected by the addition of some other aromatizable or more androgenic compound (testosterone would be the preferred remedy).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark640">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Effective doses for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes fall in the range of 5 mg per day or less, taken for no longer than 4-6 weeks to minimize the chance for virilizing side effects.

The time to peak release with Equipoise shouldn&#39;t be more than several days, however, and it is highly likely that its release pattern would actually be more even over time compared to Equilon.

In reality, however, such slow/fast blends tend to be more a product of marketing than science, as even the supposed slow-acting esters like cypionate and undecylenate produce their peak hormone release within a few days of injection at most. Regardless, products like this tend to have strong market value, so Equilon is likely to sit well with bodybuilders who have liked Equipoise in the past.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark644">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Equilon is manufactured in Myanmar only.The product is supplied in a multi-dose glass vial (6ml), which contains an oily solution; each milliliter contains 10 mg of boldenone acetate, 30 mg of boldenone propionate, 40 mg of boldenone  cypionate,  and  20  mg  of  boldenone undecylenate.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark645">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by the introduction of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2,  which  reduces  its  relative  estrogenicity  and androgenicity. Equilon contains boldenone modified with the addition of carboxylic acid esters (acetic, propionic, cyclopentylpropionic, and undecylenoic acids) at the 17- beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) boldenone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following  administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent injection  schedule  compared  to  injections  of  free (unesterified) steroid. Equilon is designed to provide a peak release of boldenone approximately 24-48 hours after injection, and sustain hormone release for approximately 21-28 days.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark646">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone  is  aromatized  in  the  body  to  estradiol (estrogen). Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia.  Boldenone  is  considered  a  mildly estrogenic steroid. Aromatization studies suggest that its rate of conversion to estradiol is roughly half that of testosterone.<span class="s33">1  </span>The  tendency  to  develop  noticeable estrogenic side effects with boldenone should be slightly higher  than  nandroione,  but  much  lower  than  with testosterone. Estrogenic side effects are usually not pronounced unless this drug is taken in doses above 200-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">400 mg per week.

The undecylenate ester extends the activity of the drug greatly (the undecylenate ester is only one carbon atom longer than decanoate), so that injections need to be repeated only once every 3 or 4 weeks.The well- balanced anabolic and androgenic properties of this drug are greatly appreciated by athletes, who generally consider it to be a stronger, slightly more androgenic, alternative to Deca-Durabolin®. It is generally cheaper, and could replace Deca in most cycles without greatly changing the end result. Boldenone undecylenate is also commonly known as a drug capable of increasing red blood cell production, although there should be no confusion that this is an effect characteristic of nearly all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark655">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Ciba  reportedly  patented  boldenone  as  a  synthetic anabolic steroid in 1949. During the 1950&#39;s and &#39;60&#39;s, the firm developed several experimental esters of the drug, and would later release a long-acting form of the agent (briefly) in the form of boldenone undecylenate. It would be sold under the brand name Parenabol, which likely referred to its characteristics as a parenteral (injectable) anabolic agent. Parenabol saw some clinical use during the late &#39;60&#39;s and early &#39;70&#39;s, mainly as a lean-tissue­ preserving anabolic agent in cases of wasting, and for the retention of bone mass with osteoporosis. Boldenone undecylenate was a short-lived preparation on human medical markets, however, and would be discontinued globally before the end of the 1970&#39;s. Squibb would ultimately be most famous for introducing this agent in the veterinary market, and would sell it under its now most famous trade name, Equipoise.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In the veterinary market, boldenone undecylenate is most commonly applied to horses, although in many regions it is indicated for use in other animals as well. It generally</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark656">exhibits  a  pronounced  effect  on  lean  bodyweight, appetite, and general disposition of the animal. The Equipoise brand was sold under the Squibb label until 1985, when Solvay acquired Squibb&#39;s U.S. animal health business. Equipoise would be sold under the Solvay label for the next several years, until Wyeth finally acquired the animal health division of Solvay in 1995. The division was formed into Fort Dodge Animal Health, which was later acquired by Pfizer. Equipoise is now marketed under the Pfizer brand name. Many other generic and brand name forms  of  boldenone  undecylenate  exist  in  numerous international drug markets as well, owing to the fact that any patents on boldenone undecylenate have long since expired.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_213.gif"/></span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone undecylenate is widely available in veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer; the majority of products are supplied as multi-dose glass vials containing an oily solution; usually carrying 25 mg/ml or 50 mg/ml of steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark657">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by the introduction of a double bond between carbons <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>and 2,  which  reduces  its  relative  estrogenicity  and androgenicity. Equipoise® contains boldenone modified with the addition of carboxylic acid ester (undecylenoic acid) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) boldenone. Esterified steroids  are  designed  to  prolong  the  window  of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free  (unesterified)  steroid.  Boldenone  undecylenate  is designed to provide a peak release of boldenone within a few days after injection, and sustain hormone release for approximately 21-28 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is interesting to note that structurally boldenone and methandrostenolone (Dianabol) are almost identical. In the case of boldenone (as applied here), the compound uses  a  17-beta  ester  (undecylenate)  to  facilitate administration, while methandrostenolone accomplishes this with the use of a <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>7-alpha alkyl group. Aside from this, the molecules are the same. Of course they act quite differently in the body, which goes to show that the 17- methylation affects more than just the oral efficacy of an anabolic/androgenic steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark658">Substance Identification:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark659">Boldenone  undecylenate  (in  oil)  can  be  positively identified using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests B &amp; D.

Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia.  Boldenone  is  considered  a  mildly estrogenic steroid. Aromatization studies suggest that its rate of conversion to estradiol is roughly half that of testosterone.<span class="s33">1  </span>The  tendency  to  develop  noticeable estrogenic side effects with boldenone should be slightly higher  than  nandrolone,  but  much  lower  than  with testosterone.

An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate might be used to help mitigate these side effects, should they become present.

The dosage schedule can be further divided  to  reduce  the  volume  of  each  injection  if necessary, perhaps administering the drug two to three times per week. One should also take caution to rotate injection sites regularly, so as to avoid irritation or infection.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Not  a  rapid  mass  builder,  boldenone  undecylenate instead provides a slow but steady gain of strength and quality muscle mass. The positive effects of this drug become most apparent when it is used for longer cycles, usually lasting 8 weeks or more in duration. The muscle gained should also not be the smooth bulk associated with testosterone, but more defined and solid.Since water bloat is not contributing greatly to the diameter of the muscle, more of the visible size gained on a cycle of boldenone undecylenate should be retained after the drug has been discontinued.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Boldenone undecylenate is a very versatile drug, and can be combined with a number of other agents depending on the desired result. For mass, it is commonly stacked with an injectable testosterone such as enanthate or cypionate.This should produce strong gains in muscle size and strength, without the same intensity of side effects of using testosterone (at a higher dose) alone. During a cutting phase, muscle hardness and density can be greatly improved  when  combining  boldenone  undecylenate with  a  non-aromatizable  steroid  such  as  trenbolone acetate  or  methenolone  enanthate.  Oral  c-17  alpha alkylated agents such as fluoxymesterone or stanozolol may also be used, but will present some level of hepatotoxicity.  For  some,  even  the  low  buildup  of estrogen associated with this compound is enough to relegate its use to bulking cycles only.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark665">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When  used  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes, women take much lower doses of boldenone undecylenate than men, typically 50-75 mg per week.

In reviewing some of the more popular products and changes on the global  pharmaceutical  market,  we  have  made  the following observations.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Brand name Equipoise is now manufactured by Pfizer in the U.S. and some other markets.

These include Ganabol, Legacy, Boldenona, and Boldegan. All are low-dose preparations, coming in at a maximum concentration of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">50 mg/mL. The exportation of these products to the United States has declined greatly over the past decade, given  the  increasing  prominence  of  higher  dosed products.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In Europe, Boldabolic from Asia Pharma is often circulated on the black market.

Specifically, each milliliter of oil contains 10 mg of testosterone acetate,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">30 mg of testosterone propionate, 20 mg of testosterone phenylpropionate, 20 mg of testosterone caproate, 40 mg of  testosterone  heptanoate  (enanthate),  20  mg  of testosterone cyclopentylpropionate (cypionate), and<span class="s13">  </span>60</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">mg  of  testosterone  Decanoate.  This  blended  ester formulation is supposed to result in a rapid increase in testosterone  level,  followed  by  a  sustained  hormone elevation for approximately 3 weeks. The design of this steroid is very similar to Sustanon®, although it contains a slightly  different  and  more  extensive  blend  of testosterones.  As  a testosterone product,  Equitest is capable of producing rapid gains in size and strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark669">Upon close analysis, Equitest offers no real advantages over Sustanon.  Its  seven  esters  all  have  very  similar pharmacokinetic properties to the four esters found in Sustanon, and will display a great deal of similarity in regards  to  the  pattern  of  testosterone  release. Furthermore, blended-ester preparations like these are pharmacologically inferior to testosterone cypionate or enanthate to begin with, as they provide a stronger supraphysiological spike of testosterone the first days of therapy, and an overall greater imbalance between the beginning and later days of each application window.The seven esters are good for marketing, however, as many buyers will identify this product as containing seven different steroids in one.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Equitest 200 was developed by WDV Pharma, which is a veterinary drug manufacturer based in Myanmar. This company has been operating since the early 1990&#39;s, and offers a full line of veterinary drug products (only a few are anabolic steroids). The small size and remoteness of this company in relation to the most active steroid markets</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_219.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">would normally have allowed it to stay very low on the radar. However, a couple of their products are unusual enough to catch the attention of dealers and importers looking for marketable items to sell. This includes the seven-testosterone blend of Equitest, as well as their 4- component  boldenone  injectable  called  Equilon  100. Equitest 200 remains available today, but is not widely distributed on the global market.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark670">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Equitest 200 is produced as a veterinary drug product in Myanmar. It contains 200 mg of testosterone ester per milliliter; packaged in 6ml vials.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark671">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Equitest 200 contains a mixture of seven testosterone compounds, which where modified with the addition of carboxylic acid esters (acetic, propionic, propionic phenyl ester,  caproic,  enanthoic,  cyclopentylpropionic,  and decanoic acids) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following  administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent injection  schedule  compared  to  injections  of  free (unesterified) steroid. Equitest 200 is designed to provide a rapid peak  in testosterone levels  (24-48 hours after injection),  and  maintain  elevated  concentrations  for approximately 21 days.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark672">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as domiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark673">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and ditoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark674">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark675">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s50">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s50">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s50">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark676">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Overall, mestanolone has an activity profile not very dissimilar from the hormone it is derived from. For starters, like DHT, mestanolone is primarily androgenic in nature, displaying a low level of anabolic activity. Both DHT and mestanolone are also devoid of estrogenic activity, which eliminates the chance for estrogenic side effects like water retention, fat deposition, and gynecomastia. In fact, both should be measurably  anti-estrogenic  in  effect,  inhibiting  the aromatase enzyme in a competitive and dose-dependant manner. Among athletes, this drug is valued for Usability to promote pure strength gains and improved aggression and focus, with minimal gains in total bodyweight.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark683">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dihydrotestosterone  was  first  synthesized  in  1935.’ Mestanolone, trivial name for the 17-alpha alkylated form of dihydrotestosterone, was produced shortly after.To spite such an old history as an investigatory agent, however, this steroid has been scarcely used in clinical medicine. The only noteworthy preparation to appear during the last forty years has been Ermalone, which was manufactured for a short period of time by Roussel Pharmaceuticals in Germany, it has since been discontinued, however. Many things probably led to the general abandonment of this steroid  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  including  an increased number of alternative agents, a lack of financial viability, and a reassessment of its tissue-building and hepatotoxic properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Most of the studies on mestanolone took place during the 1950&#39;s and &#39;60&#39;s. This was a period when a great deal of drug  development  was  taking  place.  Many  new compounds were being introduced, and many old ones were  being  reassessed  for  potential  value.  Although</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_225.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">mestanolone had been synthesized long before, the drug was seeing revitalized interest by researchers due to more recent assays showing that the agent could provide both strong androgenic and anabolic effects. For a short period of time it was believed that mestanolone would be a palatable tissue-building agent. Not long after, however, the general consensus about this agent came to be that it was an androgen, not really a strong anabolic, and that its risk profile (hepatotoxicity, lipid alterations) probably did not warrant its use over other commercial androgen preparations.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although it had a weak history as a prescription medicine, mestanolone was one of the oldest and most-valued secrets of the East German doping machine, the infamous state- sponsored doping program of the 1970s and &#39;80s that developed advanced systematic techniques designed to  assist  drug-tested  athletes  avoid  detection.  This program allowed East German athletes to evade countless urine tests and become a dominant force in Olympic sports throughout much of the Cold War era. Mestanolone was valued not for its potency as a muscle builder, but for its abilities as a pure and powerful androgen. Its effects were largely  focused  on  the  central  nervous  system  and neuromuscular  interaction.  Athletes  would  routinely comment that while the drug would not make them huge, it  was  very  capable  of  improving  speed,  strength, aggression, endurance, and resistance to stress. Drug tested or not, mestanolone remains intrinsically valuable today as a fast-acting oral androgen capable of providing tangible benefits to many users.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark684">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark685">Mestanolone is no longer available as a prescription agent.

More specifically, it is a close cousin of Dianabol,  although  this  steroid  has  been  extensively modified in comparison. Among other traits, formebolone is unable to convert to estrogen, and exhibits even less relative androgenicity in comparison.The drug is generally viewed as a very weak anabolic by athletes, and is not commonly used for building muscle. It is, however, very effective in one very novel way. When given by injection, the drug formebolone irritates the muscle tissue at the site of administration. The body will respond to this with a localized inflammation, which will cause an increase in the overall diameter of the treated muscle. This irritation can be uncomfortable, however, so each ampule of LPB Esidene contains 20 mg of added lidocaine (a local painkiller) to make the injection less painful. While this does compensate somewhat, Esidene is still relatively uncomfortable to use.The procedure is usually endured for the results, which can be dramatic in a very short period of time.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">Formebolone was first extensively studied in Italy during the early 1970&#39;s.<span class="s33">1 2 3 </span>It was developed as a steroid with increased anabolic  activity  and reduced  androgenicity compared to testosterone, with a focus on the tissue­ building  functions  of  the  hormone  and  reducing  its unwanted side effects. It was produced as both an oral and injectable medication, and was distributed in Europe. The most notable manufacturer was LPB in Italy, which sold the drug under the Esidene brand name. It was also sold in Portugal as Esidene (Biofarma), and in Spain as Hubernol (Hubber). Formebolone was used clinically as an anabolic agent,  often  to  treat  populations  susceptible  to  the androgenic  effects  of  steroids  including  women,  the elderly, and children.

Its availability would soon be in question. Of the listed brands, Hubernol from Spain would be the first product to be voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace by its manufacturer. Esidene by Biofarma soon fol lowed. Towards the end of the 199O&#39;s,the last  remaining  preparations  worldwide  to  contain formebolone were the Esidene products from LPB in Italy. Their  producer  too  would  soon  discontinue  these offerings, and by 2004, most residual stock of Esidene had completely dried up. For the first time since its release decades  earlier, the drug had officially gone out of commerce.

This  level  is  sufficient  for  noticeable increases in lean tissue mass, strength, and hardness, with little &quot;bulking&quot; effect to be seen. When the injectable form of formebolone is used for site enhancement, it is important to note that the swelling produced by this drug is only temporary. It will usually take only a week after the last injection was given for the swelling to subside. For this reason, injectable Esiclene is really only used during the last week or two before a competition. It is also usually injected on a daily basis into each lagging muscle site. Those trying to stretch out the dosage schedule may opt to inject every other day, but generally no longer of an interval is used. When stretched too many days apart, the accumulated swelling will likely not reach a desirable point.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In order to keep this procedure more comfortable, the full dosage is not to be given from the onset of the regimen. Instead, the user will generally begin with half of an ampule, or 1 mL (2mg) per muscle. After a number of days the dosage is increased to 2 mL, or a full ampule for each individual injection site. After continuing at this dosage for a week or two, one can possibly see an increase of <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>or</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1.5 inches in their arm and calf measurements. This is clearly a tremendous improvement for only two weeks&#39; use. In addition, those who have used this steroid often report the drug produces an increase in overall muscle hardness. This is an added benefit when preparing for a contest, as a large, hard, and defined muscle body is the obvious goal. Over the years, a large number of male and female competitors have relied heavily on this drug for their exceptional show physiques. Esiclene injections have no doubt been the difference between winning and losing for many competitors.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is also very important to stress that injectable Esiclene does not work well as a site-enhancement agent for every muscle  group.  Bodybuilders  experimenting  with  this compound have generally found that it is most effective with the smaller muscle groups such as the biceps, deltoid, and calf. The resultant swelling will equate to a very favorable size increase in these small muscles, looking much larger and fuller, but natural. When trying to inject Esiclene into larger muscles like the chest, back,and legs, however, one can run into trouble. The result in this case can be a very uneven look, producing lumps in the muscle body instead of a total overall size increase. For this reason, the large muscle groups are usually off limits unless the user is very experienced with the practice and his or her personal results with it.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark705">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A common clinical dose of formebolone is estimated to be</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">5  mg  per  day;  actual  prescribing  guidelines  are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark706">unavailable.

At first glance the constituents of Estandron look very familiar to Sustanon 100.lt begins with a small dose of testosterone propionate (20 mg), followed by equal amounts of testosterone phenylpropionate and testosterone isocaproate (40 mg of each).The result is a 100 mg/mL mix of testosterone that is ester-for-ester  and  milligram-for-milligram  equivalent  to this lower-dosed version of Sustanon.The only differences are the addition of Img of estradiol benzoate and 4mg of estradiol phenylpropionate, which have been included to provide estrogen to the patient as well (this product is intended  for  clinical  use  with  women).  While  this preparation does carry a formidable dose of testosterone, it is  not  widely  used  by  athletes  and  bodybuilders, particularly men, due to its high level of estrogenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark708">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estandron  is  but  one  of  many  combination testosterone/estrogen products developed over the years. These products have historically been used with women in clinical medicine when the anabolic/androgenic effects of testosterone are desired in addition to the therapeutic benefits of estrogens. This includes the treatment of osteoporosis,  menopause,  breast  cancer,  and  the suppression of lactation. Such applications are not as popular today as they were in the past, however, given that many other medications are available that are better suited for the needs of patients. The one key exception is the recent reemergence of low doses of testosterone with estrogen replacement therapy for menopause, which is proving to have numerous benefits with women when it comes to the support of lean tissue mass, bone density, energy,  and  sexual  vigor.  Estandron  is  often  used specifically  for  the  loss  of  libido  and  energy  with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">menopause,  although  it  contains  far  too  much testosterone to be widely used for this purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark709">Estandron is not widely used outside of clinical medicine. Some female bodybuilders interested in testosterone do experiment with this drug, believing the added estrogen makes it a drug for women. While true in a clinical sense, when used at the higher doses needed for bodybuilding purposes, testosterone is generally not recommended for women.The very rare male athlete will attempt its use, and may find that the estrogen helps with lipid values. Most will not go near the drug though, given that the estrogenicity of testosterone is usually more than enough to deal with during a cycle. Estandron is still fairly available for those interested, although Organon seems to be supporting the drug  much  less  these  days.  It  has  already  been discontinued in some European markets, including Italy and Austria.The most notable countries it is still being sold in include the Netherlands (Estandron Prolongatum), Chile (Estandron  Prolongado),  Brazil  (Estandron  P),  Egypt (Estandron), and Turkey (Estandron Prolongatum).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark710">Estandron is available in select human drug markets. All products are supplied in 1 mL glass ampules or pre-loaded syringes containing an oily solution; sold by or under license from Organon.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estandron  contains  a  mixture  of  three  testosterone compounds, which where modified with the addition of carboxylic acid esters (propionic, propionic phenyl ester, and isocaproic acids) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. The preparation also contains two esterified forms of estrogen: estradiol  benzoate  and  estradiol  phenylpropionate. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) hormone. Estandron is designed to provide a rapid peak in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">testosterone and estrogen levels (24-48 hours after injection), and maintain physiological concentrations for approximately 21-28 days.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark711">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). Additionally, this preparation contains two forms of active estrogen. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. This steroid preparation is considered to be highly estrogenic. An anti-estrogen such as  clomiphene  citrate  or  tamoxifen  citrate  may  be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), although it will not have an effect on the additional estrogens present in the preparation. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with highly estrogenic steroid products, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. It would only be appropriate during bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark712">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark713">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone and estrogen do not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark714">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Testosterone tends  to  have  a  much  less  dramatic  impact  on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>negative effects of androgens on serum lipids.The added estrogens in this product may further help to offset some of  the  androgenic  effect  on  lipid  values,  and  <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>preparation may, therefore, have a weaker impact on cholesterol  than  a  comparably  dosed  straight testosterone product. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation,and support left ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark715">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.  The  added  estrogens  will  also  provide negative-feedback suppression. This preparation should have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid hormones. Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark716">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Many sensitive individuals choose to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">stay away from this steroid completely, their bodies reacting with a pronounced soreness and low-grade fever <span style=" color: #393939;">that </span>may last for a few days after each injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark717">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estandron is not approved for use in men. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable. When used for physique- or performance-enhancing  purposes  (very  rarely),  this steroid preparation is usually included in a stack with other compounds, in an effort to offset some of the negative effects of testosterone on lipid values. Here, it is administered at a dosage of ) ampule per week, and usually taken for no longer than 6-12 weeks.This level will provide a replacement level dose of testosterone to help support muscle growth during a bulking phase, and should also provide a sufficient level of estrogen to affect lipids positive (compared to testosterone alone). Higher doses are likely to exacerbate estrogen-related side effects, and are generally not advised. This product is not widely used by male athletes and bodybuilders due to the estrogen content.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark718">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Estandron is used with women to treat a loss of libido and energy with menopause, when estrogens alone were insufficient to elicit a desired response.The recommended dose is 1 ampule every 4 weeks. This interval may be extended <span style=" color: #393939;">if </span>the level is deemed to provide too much androgenic  stimulation.  Estandron  is  not  generally recommended for women for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes due to its strong androgenic nature, tendency to produce virilizing side effects, and slow acting characteristics (making blood levels difficult to control). For those that choose to administer the drug, it is recommended  to  stay  within  normal  prescribing guidelines,  as  increasing  the  dose  above  the recommended level is very likely to induce significant virilizing side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark719">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Given the extremely poor demand for mixed testosterone and estrogen preparations in general on the black market, Estandron  is  scarcely  seen  in  circulation.

Nandrolone cydohexylpropionate is favored by athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to promote significant strength and lean muscle mass gains without excessive side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone cydohexylpropionate was first described in 1962. It was developed into a medicine shortly thereafter, although its adoption by pharmaceutical companies was not as rapid and widespread as the phenylpropionate and decanoate esters of nandrolone.The most notable brand name of reference for nandrolone cydohexylpropionate was Fherbolico, which was manufactured by Fher in Spain, It has also been sold under such brand names as Anabolicum &quot;Sanabo’) Androl, Megabolin, and Proteron- Depot. The drug was used principally as an anabolic to aid in the gain of lean bodyweight, as well as to combat osteoporosis. Given its mild androgenic nature, it was often applied to androgen-sensitive patients, including women and the elderly.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Most of the early preparations containing nandrolone cydohexylpropionate  have  been  removed  from  the market over the years. Given the high relative safety of nandrolone preparations, such decisions were probably voluntary ones by the manufacturers, likely based on</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">financial  considerations.  By  the  1980’s  and  1990&#39;s, nandrolone decanoate, and to a lesser extent nandrolone phenylpropionate,  dominated  the  global  nandrolone market, and there was not a great deal of money being made  with  the  lesser-known  esters.  Some  isolated preparations containing nandrolone cydohexylpropionate are still being manufactured, however, so the drug remains available in commerce.More recent products known to still use this steroid are Sanabolicum by the Nile Company in Egypt, Sanabolicum-Vet by Werfft-Chemie in Austria, and Genadrag by Drag Pharma in Chile, the latter being the most commonly located form of the drug in recent years.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark722">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone cydohexylpropionate is available in select human and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but usually contain 25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL of steroid dissolved in oil.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark723">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark724">Nandrolone cydohexylpropionate is a modified form of nandrolone,   where   a   carboxylic   acid   ester (cyclohexylpropionic acid) has been attached to the 17- beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following  administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent injection  schedule  compared  to  injections  of  free (unesterifted)  steroid.  Nandrolone  cydohexylpropionate provides a sharp spike in nandrolone release 24-48 hours following  deep  intramuscular  injection,  which  steadily declines to near baseline levels approximately 2 weeks later.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 280pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: center;">293</p><p class="s196" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 21pt;text-align: left;">I</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">testosterone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">2 </span>Consequently, estrogen- related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark725">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as a progestin in the body.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor. Sharing this trait, many 19-nor anabolic steroids are shown to have some affinity for the progesterone  receptor  as  well.<span class="s33">4  </span>The  side  effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  ditoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">interfering with libido in males when used without another androgen.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).<span class="s33">5  6  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely. Note that one case of intrahepatic cholestasis has been documented in a patient receiving long-term nandrolone cyclohexylpropionate.<span class="s33">7</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark726">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  <span style=" color: #393939;">in  </span>a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">8 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">9   </span>Nandrolone   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents.

For sake of comparison, studies administering 100 mg per week of nandroione decanoate for 6 weeks have demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy. At a dosage of 300 mg per week, this reduction  reached  7O%.<span class="s33">10  </span>It  is  believed  that  the progestational activity of nandroione notably contributes to  the  suppression  of  testosterone  synthesis  during therapy, which can be marked in spite of a low tendency for estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">11  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession.

There are at most a few low-dose products in manufacture worldwide to choose from, which have the added benefit of being very low on the radar for importers, dealers, and buyers alike. Counterfeiters presently have just as little interest in this steroid as consumers, so should you find one of the available products, the odds it will be fake are probably much lower than with most steroids. At this time you probably have the best chance of finding the Genadrag brand, which is produced by Drag Pharma in Santiago Chile.

Although  higher  doses  (450-600  mg)  may produce a stronger anabolic effect, given the relatively low concentration this drug is found in (25 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL), doses above 400 mg are not commonly applied. Instead, the drug is often stacked with another agent, usually an androgen such as an injectable testosterone, which also helps offset the very low level of androgenicity of  nandroione.  An  oral  steroid  with  pronounced androgenicity,  such  as  methandrostenolone  or oxymethoIone, is sometimes used as well, but will also present some hepatotoxicity and have a stronger effect on serum lipids (negatively).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When  used  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes, a dosage of 50 mg per week is most common.

Its  activity  is  quite removed from its structural parent, however, such that direct  comparisons  between  the  two  are  difficult. Trenbolone is a non-estrogenic steroid, and is considerably more anabolic and androgenic than nandrolone on a milligram for milligram basis. In appearance, it is much more commonly compared to a stronger androgen such as drostanolone, than it is to nandrolone. It is also estimated to display about three times more androgenic potency than  testosterone,  making  it  one  of  the  strongest injectable   anabolic   steroids   ever   commercially manufactured. Among athletes,this steroid is highly valued for its ability to increase muscle hardness, definition, and raw strength, without unwanted water retention and fat mass gains. It is considered a drug of choice for contest bodybuilders, yet remains very popular with recreational users simply looking to refine their physiques.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark732">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Trenbolone acetate was first closely studied in 1967, described during a series of experiments into synthetic anabolic steroids by Roussel-UCLAF.<span class="s33">1 </span>By the early 1970&#39;s, trenbolone acetate was being sold in England by Hoechst as Finajet, and in France as Finaject by Roussel. Roussel AG in Germany was parent to both companies. Trenbolone acetate is a drug of veterinary medicine, although a longer- acting ester of trenbolone (see: Parabolan) was once sold for human consumption as well. Trenbolone acetate is used, almost exclusively, to increase the rate of weight gain and  improve  feed  efficiency  of  cattle  shortly  before slaughter. Essentially, the drug is utilized to increase product profitability,  as measured in total  pounds of salable meat. It is generally used right up to the point of slaughter, with no withholding period. Meat products sold in many areas of the world will often contain small amounts of residual trenbolone metabolites as a result of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">this practice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone acetate first became popular among U.S. bodybuilders during the 1980&#39;s, a time when the drug was being smuggled in from Europe in high volume. It was identified  (rightly  so)  as  a  powerful  anabolic  and androgenic agent, and quickly became a drug of choice among  American  competitive  bodybuilders.  Although extremely hot for a brief period of time, the supply of trenbolone acetate ended abruptly in 1987, as Hoechst- Roussel decided to voluntarily discontinue sale of all injectable  forms  of  this  medication.  Although unconfirmed, the growing public concern about sports doping likely had much to do with this decision, as the discontinuation  of  &quot;controversial&quot;  steroids  was  very common during the late 1980&#39;s and early 1990&#39;s.This event marked  the  end  of  legitimate  medicines  containing trenbolone acetate for injection.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Around the same time as we were seeing the demise of Finajet and Finaject, Hoechst-Roussell was introducing trenbolone acetate to the U.S. market as Finaplix cattle implant pellets. This came subsequent to the FDA&#39;s approval for such products in 1987 . The pellets were designed for subcutaneous implantation into the ear of the cattle with a handheld implant gun, and are far too large to be implanted in humans without minor surgery. Remarkably, trenbolone acetate pellets are exempt from</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S. controlled substance laws.This is presumably to make it easy and affordable for livestock owners to have access to the growth-promoting agent. If a veterinarian were needed every time these products were to be used, they might be too troublesome or cost prohibitive to consider. Admittedly, since these products come in the form of pellets, they are not in a form suitable for human consumption either, making their exemption seem a little more reasonable than at first glance.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark733">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone acetate is available in select veterinary drug markets. It generally comes in the form of implant pellets containing 20 mg of trenbolone acetate each. Injectable preparations containing 30 mg/ml of steroid in oil were formerly sold.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark734">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Trenbolone is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by the introduction of double bonds at carbons 9 and 11, which inhibit aromatization (9-ene), increase androgen­ binding affinity,<span class="s33">2 </span>and slow its metabolism. The resulting steroid is significantly more potent as both an anabolic and an androgen than its nandrolone base. Trenbolone acetate contains trenbolone modified with the addition of carboxylic acid ester (acetic acid) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group,so that the free steroid is released more slowly from the area of injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark735">Substance Identification:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone acetate (in oil) can be positively identified with ROIDTESP<span class="s33">M </span>Substance Tests A &amp; D.The drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) purple color change with Substance Test D. This rapid reaction is distinct to trenbolone, and can be used (alone) to identify this (base) drug.

It is of note, however, that this steroid  displays  significant  binding  affinity  for  the progesterone   receptor   (slightly   stronger   than progesterone itself).</a><span class="s33">3 4 </span>The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient  to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by progestational  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  Note  that progestational side effects are more common when trenbolone  is  being  taken  with  other  aromatizable steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, trenbolone is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark738">sufficiently androgenic. Androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, and may include bouts of oily  skin,  acne,  and  body/facial  hair  growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and  clitoral  enlargement.  Additionally,  the  5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize trenbolone,</a><span class="s33">5 </span>so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and is generally not considered a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity is unlikely.This steroid does have a strong level of resistance to hepatic breakdown, however, and severe liver toxicity has been noted in bodybuilders abusing trenbolone.<span class="s33">6 </span>Although unlikely, hepatotoxicity cannot be completely excluded, especially with high doses.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark739">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Due to its non- aromatizable nature and strong resistance to metabolism, trenbolone has a moderate to strong (negative) impact on lipid values and atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark740">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to promote  muscle gain are expected to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.  In experimental studies,  trenbolone was determined to be approximately three times stronger at suppressing  gonadotropins  than  testosterone  on  a milligram for milligram basis.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Prescribing  guidelines  are  unavailable.  An effective dosage for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes generally falls in the range of 100-300 mg per week, taken for 6 to 8 weeks. Due to the short-acting nature of acetate esters, the total week&#39;s dosage is subdivided into 2-3 smaller applications. Effective oral doses tend to fall in the range of 100-200 mg per day, taken for no longer than 6-8 weeks to minimize any potential hepatic strain. This level is sufficient to notice strong increases in strength and lean tissue mass, with a low level of unwanted side effects. Lack of estrogenic activity  has  made  trenbolone  very  appealing  for competitive athletes looking to shed fat, while at the same time trying to avoid water retention. Here, trenbolone may provide the high androgen content needed in order to elicit a very hard, defined physique.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While it is a noteworthy hardening agent, this is not the only benefit of trenbolone acetate. It is also a strong anabolic,  with  muscle-building  properties  often compared to testosterone and Dianabol, but without the same level of water retention.This may be a little generous of a description, as its lack of estrogenic activity does seem to hurt this agent in its abilities to promote muscle mass gains. While trenbolone is often recommended as a great addition to a mass cycle, it is rarely reported to be a very powerful agent when used alone. Results are most often  reported  as  moderate  lean  tissue  growth accompanied by exceptional hardening and fat loss. Although perhaps it is not quite as potent as the more estrogenic bulking agents if sheer mass is the goal, trenbolone is still a better builder milligram for milligram than nandrolone, and likely the most anabolic of all the non-estrogenic commercial steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">For stacking, trenbolone is a very versatile steroid, and seems to work exceptionally well with other agents for both  bulking  and  cutting  purposes.

Structurally, this steroid differs from normethandrolone (Orgasteron) only by the substitution of the 13-methyl group with an ethyl. As is common for a member of the nandrolone family, norbolethone is more anabolic than androgenic in nature. Early animal studies place the anabolic index of this agent at 20 as compared to oral methyltestosterone (the standard of comparison for oral anabolic/androgenic steroids), meaning that it has<span class="s13"> </span>20</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">times higher anabolic than androgenic activity. Although</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">this figure may not translate perfectly to real-world human use, we can still expect a favorable balance <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>anabolic to androgenic effect. Comparisons to other commercially available agents would probably place norbolethone in a similar category to norethandroione, both being effective anabolic  derivatives  of  nandrolone,  but  with  some additional  estrogenic  and  progestational  activity  that makes them somewhat dissimilar to more purely anabolic agents  such  as  Winstrol,  Primobolan,  and  Anavar. Norbolethone  is  most  appropriately  considered  a bodybuilding drug, and is less ideally suited for the needs of competitive athletes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norbolethone was first described in <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>963.<span class="s33">1 </span>The drug was developed by Wyeth (Genabol, 2.5 mg), and put into human clinical trials between 1964 and 1972.

As such, after the clinical trials were published, little mention was made of this drug for approximately thirty years.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norbolethone was thrown into headlines in mid-2002, when it was announced that Dr. Don Catlin of the UCLA Analytical Laboratories had discovered that athletes were using this drug to beat the drug screens being conducted at his facility. Because norbolethone was never sold as a commercial steroid, the athletic bodies were not looking for it during earlier tests. A private chemist (later identified as Patrick Arnold) realized this, and manufactured it for the specific purpose of beating the drug screen. Catlin was clued into its use after identifying several &quot;negative&quot; samples that had signs of endogenous steroid suppression (potentially  indicating  steroid  use).  The  norbolethone doping  scandal  that  resulted  was  the  first  modern appearance of the &quot;designer steroid&quot; phenomenon. These are non-commercial steroids that do not show up on a drug screen by virtue of their anonymity. For as long as they are not known to drug-testing facilities, they will not be detected. Drugs like norbolethone are highly valued commodities among competitive athletes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Once Catlin identified norbolethone, he promptly devised and released a method for the detection of its metabolites in the urine.<span class="s33">7 </span>Several world-class athletes were ultimately suspended  for  using  this  drug  during  competition, including U.S. Olympic cyclist Tammy Thomas. With this press release, norbolethone immediately lost any value it formerly had as an undetectable designer steroid. It has been &quot;discovered,&quot; so to speak, and is now actively screened for during any serious steroid urinalysis test. There is little doubt that most of the athletes that were using this compound have long since abandoned it and moved on to better things.

It differs by 1) the addition of an ethyl group at carbon 17-alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the introduction of an ethyl group at carbon 13-alpha, which seems to intensify steroid anabolic activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark746">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Norbolethone  has  not  been  extensively  studied  in humans. Based on its structure, it is expected that norbolethone  is  aromatized.  It  should  convert  to  a synthetic estrogen with a high level of biological activity (1B,  17al  pha-diethyi-estradiol).  This  should  be  a moderately estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia may be a concern during treatment, particularly with higher doses. At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous  water  retention  and  fat  levels  build. Sensitive individuals may want to keep the estrogen under control with the addition of an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective  remedy  for  estrogen  control.  Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Based on its structure, it is expected that norbolethone has some activity as a progestin in the body. The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins  without  excessive  estrogen  levels  being present. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by  progestational anabolic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark747">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned of the  potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities,changes in skin texture,facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Note that in androgen- responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate,  structure  suggests  that  the  relative androgenicity of norbolethone is reduced by its reduction to dihydo-norbolethone.The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride may interfere  with  site-specific  reduction  of  norbolethone action, increasing the tendency of the drug to produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided  with  this  steroid  if  maintaining  low  relative androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norbolethone is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl  7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction  may  develop.  It  is  advisable  to  visit  a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature in which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or  prolonged  administration  periods.  Studies examining  the  sulfobromophthalein  (BSP)  retention effects   of   norbolethone   and   sixteen   other anabolic/androgenic steroids in animals determined the drug to be among the most active.<span class="s33">9  </span>Increased BSP retention is a common marker of hepatic stress. Later studies in humans determined that the drug was well tolerated in doses of 10 mg per day or less for up to 6 weeks of continuous use.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark748">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Norbolethone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol  due  to  its  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark749">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

It is extremely close  in  structure  to  chlorodehydromethyltestosterone (Oral Turinabol), differing only by the substitution of the basic  steroid  3-keto  group  with  a  3-hydroxyl.  It  is essentially a &quot;diol&quot; form of Oral Turinabol, and with this understanding is often described as a &quot;prohormone&quot; or &quot;prosteroid&quot; to this well-known and highly valued anabolic steroid.   While   some   conversion   to   active chlorodehydromethyltestosterone is assumed, based on its structure it is likely that this conversion is far from complete, and that much of the anabolic and androgenic activity received with use is intrinsic to CDMA.This steroid is non-aromatizable, and exhibits a greater tendency for anabolic as compared to androgenic effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol  was  first  described in 2005, when it was introduced to the U.S. supplement market as a &quot;prosteroid&quot; by Gaspari Nutrition. The agent was considered a &quot;grey market&quot; product, containing a drug that was not technically illegal due to it not being specifically listed in previous controlled substance laws. The designation of nutritional supplement, however, was viewed as highly controversial. In November 2005, Halodrol was the subject of a scathing article in the Washington Post for its unrestricted and likely illegal OTC sale.<span class="s33">1 </span>Don Catlin of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory analyzed the product for the Post, and described Halodrol as containing, &quot;a  steroid  that  closely  resembles  Oral-Turinabol,  the principal steroid used to fuel East Germany&#39;s secret, systematic sports doping program.&quot; Catlin also claimed that  the  product  contained  desoxymethytestosterone (Madol), something the manufacturer has denied.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although no specific action was taken on the part of the FDA concerning chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol, the manufacturer voluntarily discontinued its sale in mid-2006,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark756">likely fearing government sanctions if it continued </a><span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>manufacture the agent indefinitely. During its brief period of time, Halodrol was an extremely well-selling item, and by some estimates was the single best selling hormonal product ever sold over the counter in the U.S., with total sales estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Today, the original Halodrol-50 product from Gaspari is no longer manufactured, and few companies will market the active drug for fear of FDA scrutiny. In September 2006, Gaspari introduced <b>a </b>replacement formula for Halodrol called Halodrol Liquigels, which includes arachidonic acid (profiled in this book), an aromatase inhibitor, and several other ingredients to impart an anabolic effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Chlorodehydromethylandrostenediol is not available as a prescription drug product.

Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark761">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

More specifically, it is a methyltestosterone derivative, differing by the addition of 11-beta-hydroxy and 9-alpha-fluoro groups. The result is a potent orally active non-aromatizable steroid that exhibits extremely strong  androgenic  properties.  Fluoxymesterone  is considerably more androgenic than testosterone, while at the same time the anabolic effects of this agent are considered to be moderate in comparison. This makes fluoxymesterone a great strength drug, but not the most ideal agent for gaining muscle mass. The predominant effects seen when taking fluoxymesterone are increased strength,  increased  muscle  density,  and  increased definition, with only modest size increases.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark767">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone was first described in 1956.<span class="s33">1  </span>It was assayed  that  same  year,  and  shown  to  possess approximately  20  times  the  anabolic  potency  of methyltestosterone<span class="s33">2 </span>(its relative anabolic effect in humans would not be quite as strong in comparison). It was introduced to the U.S. prescription drug market shortly after under the brand name Halotestin (Upjohn), and soon after that as Ultandren (Ciba). The drug was initially described  as  halogenated  derivative  of  testosterone, possessing up to 5 times greater anabolic and androgenic potency  than  methyltestosterone.  Early  prescribing guidelines recommended its use in both sexes for the promotion of lean tissue repair and growth following such conditions as burns, delayed healing of fractures, chronic malnutrition,   debilitating   diseases,   convalescence, paraplegia,  and  catabolism  induced  by  long-term administration of cortisone. It was also used in males to treat insufficient androgen levels, and in women to treat abnormal bleeding in the uterus and advanced breast cancer.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">By the mid-1970&#39;s, the FDA had been granted much more</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">control over the U.S. drug market. One of the first major changes with steroid medicine came when the FDA required strong substantiation for each potential use of a drug.The prescribing guidelines for fluoxymesterone were soon refined to state that the drug was &quot;effective&quot; for treating various forms of androgen deficiency in males, and reducing the severity of postpartum breast pain and treating androgen-responsive inoperable breast cancer in females. It was also listed as &quot;probably effective&quot; in treating postmenopausal  osteoporosis.  Current  prescribing guidelines  for  fluoxymesterone  list  only  the  uses  of treating androgen deficiency in males and breast cancer in females.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark768">In recent years, fluoxymesterone has become viewed more and more as a controversial medication in the eyes of most clinicians. Its hepatotoxicity and potential negative impact of lipids and cardiovascular risk factors are often cited as reasons for avoiding the use of this agent in otherwise healthy males for treating androgen insufficiency. Today, testosterone  preparations  (injections,  gels,  patches, implants, etc.) are preferred for this purpose, and they supplement the same androgens missing from the body (testosterone, DHT), not more toxic synthetic derivatives. Fluoxymesterone remains for sale in the U.S. as a generic drug only. It remains available in only limited supply outside of the United States.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone  is  available  in  select  human  drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer,although generally contain 2mg,2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg per tablet.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark769">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha, which helps protect the hormone during oral administration, 2) the introduction of a fluoro group at carbon 9 (alpha) and 3) the attachment of a hydroxyl group</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark770">at carbon 11 (beta), which inhibits steroid aromatization. The latter two modifications also greatly enhance the androgenic and relative biological activity of the steroid over 17-alpha methyltestosterone.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Fluoxymesterone  can  be  positively  identified  using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp;C.With Substance Test A, the drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) green color change. With Substance Test C, it should not cause a reaction.This serves as an important control, as most oral AAS do react strongly to Substance Test C.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark771">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark772">Fluoxymesterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not  measurably  estrogenic.  An  anti-estrogen  is  not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should  not  be  a  concern  even  among  sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone is classified as an androgen. Androgenic side effects are common with this substance, and may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Those genetically prone to male pattern hair loss may wish to opt for a milder, less androgenic, anabolic steroid. As a potent androgen, this steroid may also increase aggressiveness. Women are additionally warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone appears to be a good substrate for the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. This is evidenced by the fact that a large number of its metabolites are found to be 5- alpha  reduced  androgens,<span class="s33">3  </span>which  coupled  with  its outward androgenic nature, suggests that this steroid is converting to a much more active steroid in androgen responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp and prostate. It may be possible to reduce the relative androgenicity of fluoxymesterone by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">It is also of note that fluoxymesterone has been shown to possess usual androgenic properties. In human studies</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark773">published back in 1961, the steroid displayed a much stronger  tendency  to  promote  phallic  enlargement compared  to  other  androgenic  effects  such as hair growth,  libido,  and  changes  in  vocal  pitch.</a><span class="s33">4 </span>Fluoxymesterone  was  offering  a  somewhat  different androgenic profile compared to testosterone, and as such demonstrated that it was possible, at some level, <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>actually tailor drug effect within the broad category of androgenic action. Fluoxymesterone remains considered an androgen, but studies like the above suggest that <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>may  not  offer  a  complete  biological  equivalent  to testosterone where androgenicity is concerned.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound.This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction  may develop. It is advisable to visit  <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Studies administering 20 mg of fluoxymesterone to a group of nine male subjects <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>two  weeks  resulted  in  most  patients  (6/9)  noticing abnormal  sulfobromophthalein  (BSP)  retention,<span class="s33">5  </span>a marker of liver stress.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while <span style=" color: #393939;">taking </span>any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark774">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Fluoxymesterone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to  liver  breakdown  and  route  of  administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely <span style=" color: #393939;">affect </span>blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark775">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Although not fully understood, fluoxymesterone is proposed to have a direct suppressive effect on testicular steroidogenesis that is not mediated by the suppression gonadotropins.<span class="s33">6</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">an effective oral daily dosage would fall in the range of IQ- 40 mg, taken in cycles lasting no more than 6-8 weeks to minimize  hepatotoxicity.  This  level  is  sufficient  for measurable increases in muscle strength, which may be accompanied by modest increases in lean muscle mass.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Fluoxymesterone  is  commonly  used  by  athletes  in weight-restricted sports like wrestling, powerlifting, and boxing, due to the fact that strength gained from the drug is  usually  not  accompanied  by  great  increases  in bodyweight.  When  properly  used,  it  can  allow  a competitor to stay within a specified weight range, yet drastically improve his performance. Fluoxymesterone is also  commonly  used  for  bodybuilding  contest preparation. When the competitor has an acceptably low body  fat  percentage,  the  strong  androgen  level  (in absence of excess estrogen) can elicit an extremely hard and defined (&quot;ripped&quot;) look to the muscles. The shift in androgen/estrogen  ratio  additionally  seems  to  bring about a state in which the body may be more inclined to burn off excess fat and prevent new <span style=" color: #393939;">fat </span>storage. The &quot;hardening&quot; effect of fluoxymesterone would, therefore, be  somewhat  similar  to  that  seen  with  trenbolone, although it will be without the same level of mass gain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In cutting phases, a milder anabolic such as Deca- Durabolin® or Equipoise® is commonly stacked with fluoxymesterone, as they provide good anabolic effect without   excessive   estrogen   buildup.   Here, fluoxymesterone  provides  a  well-needed  androgenic component, helping to promote a more solid and defined gain in muscle mass, with less interference with energy</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 68%;text-align: left;">discussion of potential side effects, see the Steroid Side Effec<span class="s51">a</span>ts<span class="s51">nd libido, than might be obtained with a primarily</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark776">section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (General):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Prescribing guidelines generally advise that oral steroids can be taken with or without meals.

Modern prescribing guidelines call for a daily dosage of 5-20 mg. Therapy is usually initiated at the full 20 mg dosage, which is later adjusted downward to meet the individual needs of the patient. The drug would be continued long-term unless laboratory tests (lipids, liver enzymes, etc.) or side effects contraindicate its continued use. For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">anabolic agent alone. Perhaps Primobolan®-Depot would be an even better choice, as with such a combination there is no buildup of estrogen, and likewise even less worry of water and fat retention. For mass, one might alternately use an injectable testosterone. A mix of 400 mg per week of testosterone enanthate and 20-30 mg daily of fluoxymesterone, for example, often provides exceptional increases in strength and lean muscle mass.

This agent is a c17-alpha alkylated analog of epitiostane (see Thioderon), and like this drug also displays a favorable balance between anabolic and androgenic effect. In this case, however, the separation is considerably more pronounced, with the drug exhibiting an  anabolic  effect  that  is  roughly  12  times  more pronounced than its androgenic effect.That is according to the standard animal assays, which often vary somewhat <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>experiences in humans.This drug was never clinical tested in humans, so what is known of it is based on a small number  of  animal  experiments,  and  structural  and anecdotal observations. What can be stated with certainty if that methepitiostane is a primarily anabolic steroid with a pronounced level of activity, and is effective for the promotion of lean mass and strength gains. It likely also imparts some anti-estrogenic effect, further strengthening the association between this agent and dieting, cutting, and lean muscle mass phases of training as opposed to bulking.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane  was  first  described  in  1966,  during investigations into a series of A-ring modified androstane derivatives.<span class="s33">1 </span>That same year it was assayed for anabolic and androgenic potency via the standard <span style=" color: #393939;">rat </span>assays, and demonstrated both pronounced anabolic properties and very weak relative androgenicity.<span class="s33">2 </span>The assay results were probably  most  similar  to  desoxymethyltestosterone (Madol),  although  methepitiostane  is  about  half  as androgenic. Although the results of the early testing were very favorable, this agent never progressed to the point <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>being a commercial steroid product or even tested <span style=" color: #393939;">on </span>human subjects. Like a great many steroids, it was examined but not actualized as a prescription product. For forty years, the agent would be lost to the public, existing as an item of research interest only.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="159" alt="image" src="img/Image_250.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane would emerge from research obscurity at the end of 2006, when a new company called Recomp Performance Nutrition introduced it to the U.S. market under the trade name Havoc. It would be sold openly as a dietary supplement.This channel of sales does not reflect a weak potency or &quot;non-steroid&quot; classification, however, as methepitiostane is very much a potent drug. It is being sold as such due to the fact that the U.S. dietary supplement market is not tightly regulated, and the drug was never classified (specifically according to the law) as an anabolic steroid. While regulations do exist that would prevent the sale of an unapproved new drug as a food supplement, they do not carry the same weight as the anabolic steroid laws, and have historically not been aggressively enforced. Methepitiostane remains on sale as of December 2006, although the manufacturer has stated that they plan to discontinue the product very shortly.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane was never approved as a prescription drug preparation. It is being sold in the U.S. supplement market under the trade name Havoc, and is supplied in the form of capsules containing 10 mg of steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane   is   a   modified   form   of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by 1) the addition of a 17- alpha methyl group, which helps protect the steroid from metabolism  during  oral  administration,  and  2)  the replacement  of  3-keto  with  2,3alpha-epithio,  which increases  anabolic  strength  while  reducing  relative androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. Furthermore, its non-methylated analog mepitiostane (Thioderon) is used clinically for its inherent antiestrogenic effect. Some level of antiestrogenic</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark781">effect is also assumed with methepitiostane. An anti­ estrogen is, likewise, not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns. Note that some users may notice lethargy with this steroid, which may be due, in part, to its low androgenic or estrogenic component. Stacking  it  with  an  aromatizable  androgen  like testosterone should alleviate this problem.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Methepitiostane is a steroid with very low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. Note that methepitiostane is unaffected by  the  5-alpha  reductase  enzyme,  so  its  relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s119" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark782">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Methepitiostane  has  a  strong  effect  on  the  hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown, non-aromatizable nature, and route of administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark783">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark784">The above side effects are not inclusive.

An  effective dosage  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes falls in the range of 10-20 mg daily.This is usually taken for no longer than 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid significant liver strain. At this level the drug should impart a measurable but moderate lean-mass-building effect, which, depending on dietary and metabolic factors, may be accompanied by measurable fat loss and an increase in definition. Doses of 30 mg per day are also commonly used, however given the high relative potency of the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark785">steroid may present significant hepatotoxicity.

This would be taken for no longer than 4-6 weeks, in an effort to avoid significant liver strain or virilizing side effects. Given that complete separation of anabolic and androgenic effect has not been achieved with any steroid, this agent is still capable of producing virilizing activity given the right dose or individual sensitivity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark786">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Methepitiostane  is  currently  only  produced  as  an underground/designer steroid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s67" style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s65">1  </span>Anabolic <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">agents. 2,3-Epithioandrostane derivatives.

More specifically, it is testosterone with an added 4-hydroxl group, an alteration that drastically alters the activity of this steroid. In action it is only moderately anabolic and androgenic, with both traits significantly reduced in potency compared to testosterone. When looking  at  its  activity  profile,  hydroxytestosterone  is classified as an anabolic steroid, with a much lower level of relative  androgenicity  compared  to  the  primary  male androgen.This steroid is additionally non-estrogenic (anti­ estrogenic actually), and as such tends to promote lean mass and strength gains, whereas testosterone is primarily thought of as a bulking agent. Ultimately, this steroid bears little resemblance to the androgen that it is so closely related to on a molecular level, and is often applied in very different circumstances by athletes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hydroxytestosterone  was  originally  developed  by  the pharmaceutical  manufacturing  giant  G.D.  &amp;  Searle. Methods for its synthesis were first patented in 1956.<span class="s33">1 </span>Studies on its pharmacology were published soon after, and have determined that (when given by injection as an acetate)  this  steroid  had  approximately  65%  of  the anabolic potency of testosterone propionate, with only <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">25%   </span>of   the   androgenicity.<span class="s33">2   </span><span class="s50">3   </span>This   makes hydroxytestosterone  a  fairly  favorable  anabolic  drug, displaying a much lower tendency to produce androgenic side effects than to increase protein synthesis. In spite of this, however, the drug never did make it to the shelf as a commercial prescription steroid product. It simply lay lost in the research books for decades, the manufacturer and patent holder probably finding little financial incentive to market it next to the many other anabolic agents available.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hydroxytestosterone emerged from its research obscurity in 2004, when it was sold very briefly in the United States as</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="159" alt="image" src="img/Image_256.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">an OTC nutritional supplement.This had to do simply with the fact that the steroid was naturally occurring, and (not being developed into a medicine) had not been identified by lawmakers at the time the first Anabolic Steroid Control Act went into effect. It was not specifically included, and thus  exempt.  As  with  all  naturally  occurring  non­ methylated    steroid    hormones,    however, hydroxytestosterone is not intrinsically very orally active, and pharmaceutical delivery (injection) was not viable as a supplement. Hydroxytestosterone will work, but you must get the steroid into your body first. This necessitated the development  of  commercial  ester-modified  softgels (similar to Andriol in design), as well as transdermal formulas (similar to Androgel). Some consumers also made their  own  injections  out  of  raw  hydroxytestosterone powder. While the latter option may be preferred in a bioavailability sense, such practices were generally not recommended, as they were not inclined to produce a sterile pharmaceutical-quality medicine.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">This steroid was generally a very effective one, and when sold as a supplement, seemed to be well-tolerated by consumers. There were no reports of acute side effects beyond  those  produced  by  the  normal  androgenic properties of the drug. Still, this agent would be very short­ lived on the consumer market. By late 2004, Congress had passed an amendment to the original Anabolic Steroid Control Act that would add a number of OTC compounds to the Federal list of controlled drugs, hydroxytestosterone included.The amended law went into effect in early 2005. All supplement products containing this anabolic steroid were subsequently removed from market. Residual stock was generally pulled from commerce at the same time as well. Presently, hydroxytestosterone is again unavailable to athletes.  Its  future  development  into  a  commercial medicine seems highly unlikely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Hydroxytestosterone is not available as a commercial</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark788">agent.

Estrogenic side effects such as increased water retention, fat gain, and gynecomastia are not likely with use. Note that hydroxytestosterone also has strong aromatase-inhibiting activities. This steroid differs from  the  suicide  aromatase  inhibitor  formestane  (4- hydroxyandrostenedione) only in that it is the active form of the steroid (17-beta hydroxysteroid) instead of the inactive dione (17-ketosteroid), and in the body is a precursor  to  formestane.  Both  formestane  and hydroxytestosterone  directly  inhibit  the  aromatase enzyme, although the former (possessing a 3-keto group) is a more appropriate fit for the enzyme, and is therefore comparably more  effective.<span class="s33">4  </span>Regardless of its lower potency, hydroxytestosterone will still effectively lower serum estrogen, reducing the estrogenic side effects caused by the aromatization of other steroid compounds. This agent may, therefore, be looked at as a dual-purpose anabolic/aromatase-inhibiting drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark790">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Hydroxytestosterone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol than testosterone or nandroione due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a much weaker impact than c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark792">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Note  that hydroxytestosterone is not extensively metabolized by the  5-alpha  reductase  enzyme,  so  its  relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hydroxytestosterone  is  not  a  c17-alpha  alkylated compound, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects.

Effective doses for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes are in the range of 200-400 mg per week by injection, or 100-300 mg daily if taking an oil- solubilized  oral  product  or  transdermal.  Maximum aromatase inhibition is likely reached by 250 mg per week when given by injection, or 100-200 mg per day when taking oral softgels. Users often keep the doses limited to this range if estrogen minimization is the main focus. Hydroxytestosterone and formestane may not be quite as</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">potent as the selective third generation non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors Arimidex or Femara, but they do seem to do a much better job here than the &quot;standard <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">issue&quot;  </span>estrogen  receptor  antagonists  Nolvadex  and Clomid (especially when it comes to shedding water and producing the tight &quot;high androgen&quot; look).

The laurate ester applied here is two carbon atoms longer than decanoate, and consequently this agent forms a slightly longer-lasting drug deposit around the area of injection than Deca-Durabolin. Given its strong  delayed-release  properties,  it  is  possible  to administer nandrolone laurate once every three to four weeks in a medical setting. As a nandrolone injectable, this drug provides a moderately strong anabolic effect, which is accompanied by a low level of estrogenic and androgenic properties. Although not widely used, nandrolone laurate is favored by athletes and bodybuilders for its ability to promote slow steady gains in lean mass with minimal side effects.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone laurate was developed during the 1960&#39;$, a time when many new nandrolone esters were being synthesized and investigated. This long-acting ester of nandrolone is usually identified as a veterinary drug, but was actually prescribed to humans before it was adopted for animal use. The only brand name of reference is Clinibolin, which was sold for a brief time on the German drug market around the end of the 1960&#39;s. Nandrolone laurate was ultimately short-lived as a human medication, however, and from this point on would be used exclusively in veterinary preparations.There is nothing particular that makes the drug poorly suited for human use, and its discontinuance probably had much more to do with the dominance of Organon&#39;s Deca-Durabolin, which made nandrolone laurate fairly superfluous as a prescription drug, than any faults of the drug itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">As a veterinary drug, nandrolone laurate is most commonly identified with the Laurabolin brand name. Laurabolin is manufactured by Intervet, and is found in a variety of countries  including  Mexico,  Chile,  The  Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia. It is used with cats, dogs, horses,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_260.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark798">pigs and cattle, typically to offset malnutrition caused by viral or parasitic illness, to treat anemia, counter the catabolic effects of corticosteroids, and to improve the overall  physical  condition  of  highly  active  or  elderly animals. The Laurabolin brand has also been sold at one time by Werfft-Chemie in Austria and Vemie in Germany, however these products have since been discontinued. In addition to the Laurabolin brand name, the drug had also been marketed in the past under the trade names Fortadex (Hydro, Germany), Fortabol (Parfam, Mexico),and Lauradrol 250 (Loeffler, Mexico).Today, only the Intervet products are known to exist.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark799">Nandrolone laurate is available in select veterinary drug markets.

Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) nandrolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nandrolone laurate is designed to provide a slow release of nandrolone for up to 3 to 4 weeks following injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark800">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone has a low tendency for estrogen conversion, estimated to be only about 20% of that seen with testosterone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is because while the liver can convert nandrolone to estradiol, in other more active sites of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">steroid aromatization such as adipose tissue nandrolone is far less open to this process.<span class="s33">2 </span>Consequently, estrogen- related side effects are a much lower concern with this drug than with testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels may still be noticed with higher dosing, however, and may cause side effects such as increased water retention, body fat gain, and gynecomastia. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects if they occur. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is of note that nandrolone has some activity as <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>progestin in the body.<span class="s33">3 </span>Although progesterone is a c-19 steroid, removal of this group as in 19-norprogesterone creates a hormone with greater binding affinity for its corresponding receptor.

Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an  anti-estrogen,  which  inhibits  the  estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark801">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Nandrolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. It is also important to point out that due to its mild androgenic nature and ability to suppress endogenous  testosterone,  nandrolone  is  prone  to interfering  with  libido  in  males  when  used  without</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">another androgen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark802">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of nandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronandrolone  (DHN).</a><span class="s33">5  6  </span>The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of nandrolone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site­ specific  reduction  of  nandrolone  action,  considerably increasing  the  tendency  of  nandrolone  to  produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with nandrolone if low androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Nandrolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects.

This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level  of  resistance  to  hepatic  metabolism.  Studies administering 600 mg of nandrolone decanoate per week for 10 weeks demonstrated a 26% reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.<span class="s33">7 </span>This suppression is slightly greater than that reported with an equal dose of testosterone enanthate, and is in agreement with earlier studies showing a slightly stronger negative impact on HDL/LDL ratio  with  nandrolone  decanoate  as  compared  to testosterone   cypionate.<span class="s33">8   </span>Nandrolone   injectables, however, should still have a significantly weaker impact on  serum  lipids  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark804">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. For sake of comparison, studies administering 100 mg per week of nandrolone decanoate for 6 weeks have demonstrated an approximate 57% reduction in serum testosterone levels during therapy. At a dosage of 300 mg per week, this reduction  reached  70%.<span class="s33">9  </span>It  is  believed  that  the progestational activity of nandrolone notably contributes to  the  suppression  of  testosterone  synthesis  during therapy, which can be marked in spite of a low tendency for estrogen conversion.<span class="s33">10  </span>Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 2-6 months of drug secession.

Prescribing guidelines are unavailable. When used for physique- or performance- enhancing purposes, a dose of 200-400 mg given every 7-10 days is most common, taken in cycles 8 to 12 weeks in length. This level is sufficient for most users to notice measurable gains in lean muscle mass and strength, which should be accompanied by a low level of estrogenic and androgenic activity. Higher doses (450-600 mg every 7-10 days) will impart a stronger anabolic effect, but can be difficult given the relatively low concentration this steroid is usually found in. Instead, many  opt  to  combine  this  agent  with  other anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  Given  its  properties,  it seems to fit well for both bulking and cutting purposes, and can reasonably replace Deca-Durabolin in cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark806">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nandrolone laurate is not approved for use in humans.

The two steroids are present in a dose of 45 mg/mL and 30 mg/mL respectively. This adds up to a total steroid concentration of 75 mg/mL. As a blend of methandriol and nandrolone, Libriol can be categorized as a moderately strong anabolic steroid with mild androgenic properties. It is also mildly estrogenic,  owing  to  its  methandriol  content.  This preparation can essentially be viewed as a fast-acting version of Ranvet’s Tribolin. Although not widely available, this product is an effective muscle-building drug, which generally produces lean gains as opposed to strong mass increases.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Libriol is a product of RWR Veterinary Products (formerly a subsidiary of Nature Vet), sold only on the Australian veterinary drug market. It is used exclusively for horses, generally  racehorses  that  need  rehabilitation  or improvements in general health and performance. The drug  combination  is  prescribed  to  increase  lean muscularity ofthe animal, help maintain proper fluid levels and avoid dehydration, and to improve the digestion and assimilation of proteins from feed. For a horse weighing approximately 1,100 pounds (500kg), a dosage of 5 mL (350 mg) is generally administered once every 2 weeks. As a &quot;pre-stacked&quot; steroid preparation, this steroid has piqued a great deal of interest among bodybuilders historically, and at one time would fetch a fairly high price on the black market due to the uniqueness of its formulation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Libriol has been on the Australian market for many years, and remains available today in spite of the growing publicity paid to sports doping and the declining interest of legitimate companies to market these drugs. It is of note that RWR discontinued use of the long-standing Libriol trade name in 2005, however, registering a new trade name</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark811">for  the  product,  RWR  4  Fillies.  The  same nandrolone/methandriol   formulation   thus   remains available on the Australian market, for those veterinarians that  have  come  to  rely  on  Libriol  as  an  effective anabolic/tonic aid. Due to tight government controls, it is unlikely that much volume of the new RWR 4 Fillies product will be diverted for athletic use. Given the low per­ milliliter steroid concentration and diverse competition of today&#39;s market, this product is additionally much less desirable than it used to be.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Libriol is available on the Australian veterinary drug market, sold presently under the trade name RWR 4 Fillies.

Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark818">section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark819">Libriol has not been approved for use in humans.

Desoxymethyltestosterone is thought of as a cousin to methyltestosterone, although the association between the two steroids is very loose.  The unique thing about desoxymethyltestosterone is that it is structurally a 2-ene compound, lacking the 3-keto group present on most commercial anabolic steroids. This lack of a 3-keto group, however, does not mean desoxymethyltestosterone is a weak compound. Quite the contrary, it is an exceedingly potent oral steroid. According to the standard rat assays, desoxymethyltestosterone exceeds methyltestosterone in oral potency by a factor of 12.<span class="s33">1 </span>At the same time, its androgenicity is recorded to be only 87% higher, giving desoxymethyltestosterone   an   extremely   favorable anabolic to androgenic ratio (measured to be nearly 6.5:1). The  resulting  steroid  is  considerably  different  than methyltestosterone, a drug which is both significantly weaker mg for mg than desoxymethyltestosterone, and possesses  a  much  more  formidable  androgenic component.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark823">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Desoxymethyltestosterone was first described in 1963.<span class="s33">2 </span>This agent was never made available as a commercial prescription  drug  product,  and  saw  only  limited investigation in animals during the mid-1960&#39;s before disappearing into research obscurity.This agent remained hidden  in the library bookshelves for decades, until reemerging in 2005 as a new &quot;designer steroid&quot; of interest to international sports doping officials.This was due to the confiscation of a sample of DMT at the Canadian border in December of 2003, where it was found in the possession of Canadian sprinter Derek Dueck during a routine vehicle inspection.

The UCLA Olympic Laboratory was successful in its quest to    outline    methods    for    detecting desoxymethyltestosterone in the urine, and these methods have been made available to all Olympic drug-testing labs. They have also been published,and as such are available to any other agency that wants to take an interest in its detection as well. Any sport that has its athletes&#39; urine samples analyzed at an accredited laboratory will likely be checking for DMT at this point. Still, it is an oral steroid, and likely most metabolites are cleared from the body within a few weeks of stopping its use (not unlike most oral steroids).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark824">Desoxymethyltestosterone was never sold as a commercial prescription anabolic steroid; however, it did appear on the sports nutrition market in 2005 under the brand name ErgoMax LMG (Lean Mass Generator). It was subsequently made available under many other brand names, and for quite some time was highly popular in the United States. The FDA began taking action against manufacturers of the compound in 2009, and all such compounds should have been withdrawal from market since. Note that Madol was added to the U.S. controlled substances list in January of 2010.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark825">Desoxymethyltestosterone  is  not  available  as  a prescription drug product.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Desoxymethyltestosterone  is  a  modified  form  of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by 1) the addition of a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark826">methyl group at carbon 17-alpha, which helps protect the hormone during oral administration, 2) the introduction of a double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (2-ene) and 3) the removal of the 3-keto group (des-oxy).The latter two modifications greatly enhance the anabolic and relative biological activity of the steroid, partly by preventing the reduction  of  DMT  to  inactive  3-hydroxysteroid metabolites.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark827">Desoxymethyltestosterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not  known to be measurably  estrogenic or progestational. An anti-estrogen should not be necessary when using this steroid. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with  water  retention,  this  steroid  instead  tends  to produces a lean, quality look to the physique for most users. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns. Note that some sensitive individuals do report estrogen-like side effects from this steroid, which suggests that  it  may  have  some  low  level  </a><span style=" color: #393939;">of  </span>estrogen  or progesterone receptor binding.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark828">Although desoxymethyltestosterone is classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance.These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Higher doses are more likely to cause such side effects. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned of the potential virilizing effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, </a><span style=" color: #393939;">and </span>clitoral enlargement. Desoxymethyltestosterone is unaffected by the  5-alpha  reductase  enzyme,  so  its  relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Desoxymethyltestosterone  is  a  d  7-alpha  alkylated compound.  This  alteration  protects  the  drug  from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17-alpha alkylated anabolic/androgenic steroids can be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver damage. In rare instances life­ threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark829">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Desoxymethyltestosterone has a strong effect on the hepatic  management  of cholesterol  due to its  non- aromatizable  nature,  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown,   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark830">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark831">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Here, the DHT backbone has been modified with a 2-methyl group to increase  its  anabolic  properties,  making  this  agent significantly more effective at promoting the growth of muscle  tissue  than  its  non-methylated  parent. Drostanolone propionate is described in product literature as a &quot;steroid with powerful anabolic and anti-estrogenic properties,&quot; and indeed does seem to share some of both properties. Admittedly, however, its anabolic properties are more properly described as moderate, especially when placed in the context of other agents. The drug is most often used by dieting bodybuilders and athletes in speed sports, where it is highly favored for its ability to produce solid increases in lean muscle mass and strength, which are usually accompanied by reductions in body fat level and minimal side effects.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone propionate was first described in 1959.<span class="s33">1 </span>Syntex developed the agent alongside such other well- known  steroids  as  Anadrol  and  methyldrostanolone (Superdrol),  also  first  described  in  the  same  paper. Drostanolone  propionate  would  be  introduced  as  a prescription drug product approximately a decade later. Lilly had an agreement with Syntex to split certain research and development costs in exchange for the rights to market the results of that research. Lilly would, therefore, sell drostanolone propionate in the U.S. under the Drolban brand name, while Syntex would sell/license it in other markets. Products included Masteron in Belgium (Sarva- Syntex) and Portugal (Cilag), Masteril in the U.K. and Bulgaria,and Metormon in Spain. Drostanolone propionate was also found in such popular preparations as Permastril (Cassenne,  France),  Mastisol  (Shionogi,  Japan),  and Masterid (Grunenthal, Germany Democratic Republic).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">drostanolone propionate for the treatment of advanced inoperable breast cancer in postmenopausal women. This remained the principle clinical indication for the agent in all international markets as well.The prescribing literature reminds  doctors  and  female  patients  that  there  is considerably less virilization with drostanolone propionate as compared to equal doses of testosterone propionate, suggesting this was a much more comfortable alternative to testosterone injections for the given audience. Still, the given dosage level (300 mg per week) was relatively high, and the literature also reminds us that mild virilization symptoms still commonly occur, such as deepening of the voice, acne, facial hair growth, and enlargement of the clitoris. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>also reports that marked virilization sometimes follows long-term therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark837">While highly popular among athletes during the 1970&#39;s and  ’80&#39;s,  drostanolone  propionate  ultimately  enjoyed limited success as a prescription agent. Manufacturers began  voluntarily  discontinuing  sale  of  the  agent  in various markets before long, likely due to the advent of more effective therapies for breast cancer, as well as the slow decline in steroid prescriptions for this phase of treatment. One of the first preparations to go was the U.S. Drolban, which was removed from market during the late 1980&#39;s. Permastril and Metormon were soon dropped as well. The last remaining Western preparation containing drostanolone  propionate  was  Masteron  from  Belgium, which  disappeared  by  the  late  1990&#39;s.  Drostanolone propionate remains listed on the U.S. Pharmacopias, suggesting there is presently no legal roadblock to its sale, although its reemergence as a prescription drug product seems highly unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone propionate is no longer available as a prescription drug preparation. When produced, it was supplied in the form of 1 mL and 2 mL ampules and 10 mL vials containing 50 mg/ml or 100 mg/ml of steroid in oil.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark838">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone  (also  known  as  dromostanolone)  is  a modified form of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by the introduction of a methyl group at carbon-2 (alpha), which considerably  increases  the  anabolic  strength  of  the steroid by heightening its resistance to metabolism by the 3-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  enzyme  in  skeletal muscle tissue. Drostanolone propionate is a modified form of drostanolone, where a carboxylic acid ester (propionic  acid)  has  been  attached  to  the  17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) drostanolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration,  allowing for a less frequent injection  schedule  compared  to  injections  of  free (unesterified)  steroid.  The  half-life  of  drostanolone propionate is approximately two days after injection.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark839">Substance Identification:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark840">Drostanolone  propionate  (in  oil)  can  be  positively identified using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp; D. With Substance Test D, the drug should produce a delayed color change to purple, taking up to 4-5 minutes to be noted. The drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) dark brown color change in Substance Test A.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark841">Drostanolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, drostanolone instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns. As a non- aromatizable DHT derivative, drostanolone may impart an anti-estrogenic effect, the drug competing with other (aromatizable) substrates for binding to the aromatase enzyme.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher than normal therapeutic doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark842">and clitoral enlargement. Drostanolone is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue­ building  actions,  making  the  threshold  for  strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more  androgenic  agents  such  as  testosterone, methandrostenolone,  or  fluoxymesterone.  Note  that drostanolone is unaffected by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark843">Drostanolone is not d 7-alpha alkylated, and not known to have hepatotoxic properties. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Drostanolone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandrolone due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a weaker  impact  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  steroids. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark844">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Prescribing  guidelines  are  unavailable.  For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, this drug is usually injected three times per week. The total weekly dosage is typically 200-400 mg, which is taken for 6-12 weeks.This level of use is sufficient to provide measurable gains in lean muscle mass and strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone propionate is often combined with other steroids for an enhanced effect. Common stacks include an  injectable  anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin® (nandrolone  decanoate)  or  Equipoise®  (boldenone undecylenate),  which  can  provide  notably  enhanced muscle gains without excessive water retention. For mass gains, it is often combined with an injectable testosterone. The result here can be solid muscle gain, with a lower level of water retention and other estrogenic side effects than if these steroids were used alone (usually in higher doses). Masteron, however, is most commonly applied during cutting phases of training. Here it is often combined with other  non-aromatizable  steroids  such  as  Winstrol®, Primobolan®, Parabolan, or Anavar, which can greatly aid muscle retention and fat loss, during a period which can be very catabolic without steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark846">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The prescribing guidelines for Drolban recommended a dose of 100 mg given three times per week. Therapy is given for a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks before an evaluation of its efficacy is made. If successful, the drug may be continued for as long as satisfactory results are obtained. Note that virilization symptoms were common at the recommended dosage. When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, a dosage of 50 mg per week is most common, taken for 4 to 6 weeks. Virilization symptoms are rare in doses of 100 mg per week or below. Note  that  due  to  the  short-acting  nature  of  the propionate ester, the total weekly dosage is usually subdivided  into  smaller  injections  given  once  every second or third day.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark847">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Drostanolone  propionate  is  scarcely  available  as  a pharmaceutical product.

Clostebol  is  4-chloro-testosterone,  a modification  that  makes  this  steroid  a  low  strength anabolic  compound  with  minimal  androgenic  potency. This analog of testosterone is also not 17-alpha alkylated and does not aromatize, so there is little worry of water retention, gynecomastia, or liver toxicity during use. The hydrogen substitution at the 4 position does not greatly enhance the oral efficacy of this drug, however, so the injectable  is  much  more  potent  on  a  milligram  for milligram  basis,  and  generally  preferred.  Although  a derivative of the potent androgen testosterone, clostebol is certainly <span style=" color: #393939;">far </span>removed from its parent steroid in action, and generally favored by athletes for its mildness, not raw power.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clostebol acetate was first described in 1956.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine in Europe, where it was sold as Steranabol  (Farmitalia,  Germany)  and  Turinabol (Jenapharm, GDR).

Both oral and injectable forms of the drug were produced, although the injectable was more popularly used. Clostebol acetate was commonly used with women and the elderly in European medicine, making clear the relative mildness of this anabolic. The side effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids  can  be  much  more  pronounced  in  these populations, so typically very weak androgens are shown to be the most tolerable here.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although quite favorable in effect and patient comfort, clostebol acetate was never a widely successful anabolic, <span style=" color: #393939;">and </span>saw only limited use in a small number of markets.

Pharmacia  would  acquire Farmitalia in 1993, although for a short point thereafter Megagrisevit  was  still  being  manufactured  under  the Pharmacia label. This did not last long, however, and Pharmacia eventually tightened up its line and removed this steroid from its offerings. Clostebol acetate had also appeared for some time in Japan, sold as Macrobin by the firm  Tetkoku,  but  this  product  too  has  since  been discontinued.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although the more functional injectable preparations of this steroid are off the market, clostebol acetate is still manufactured in a number of dermal preparations. The most  recognizable  such  product  has  been  Alfa- Trofodermin from Italy, although it has also been sold in such products as Neobol (Mexico), Trofodermin (Chile, Brazil), and Novaderm (Brazil). Dermal preparations of clostebol acetate are generally used to treat ulcers and wounds,  and  often  include  some  neomycin  to  help accelerate healing. The doses of steroid used in these products is generally very small, however, and, combined with poor systemic delivery, are not of much use to athletes. In addition, this steroid has even been included in certain ophthalmologic solutions, which are even less practical to use for performance-enhancing purposes, and of less interest. Given that Megagrisevit was the last remaining effective oral or injectable steroid product to contain clostebol acetate, this drug is now essentially a defunct item as far as the athletic use of steroids are concerned.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Clostebol acetate is no longer available as a commercial oral or injectable agent.

The drug is administered for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a break for 3 weeks. It is resumed at this point if indicated. Effective doses for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes fall in the range of 100-300 mg per week, taken for 6-12 weeks. Given the fast-acting nature of acetate  injectables,  the  weekly  dosage  is  generally subdivided into injections given at least every third day. With the low dosage of previous commercial clostebol acetate products, daily injectable were most common. Given the lower bioavailability and higher price, oral forms of the drug were not commonly used by athletes. When administered, a daily dosage of 60-90 mg appeared to be the most common.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: left;">The anabolic effect of this drug is fairly weak, so clostebol acetate is most often utilized in combination with other</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">steroids for a stronger effect.The general application is to use it for contest preparations with other non-aromatizing anabolics such as Winstrol® or oxandrolone. Here, a daily dose of 20 mg may be added in with an average dose (20- 30 mg per day) of the oral anabolic, which together should provide the user a nice muscle building effect without any water  retention.  The  effect  of  clostebol  would  be somewhat similar to that seen with the old Primobolan® acetate ampules, although Megagrisevit is somewhat weaker in effect. Some also opt to use this compound in addition with strong non-aromatizing androgens such as trenbolone, Halotestin®, or Proviron®. The result in such cases can be an even more pronounced effect of muscle definition, although this will be accompanied by a much stronger set of side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark855">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clostebol acetate is generally used in clinical doses 30 mg per week by injection or 15 mg 2-3 times per day orally.

This agent is also called trestolone acetate, although not as commonly.  The  trivial  name  methylnortestosterone  is vague, and can also be applied to other steroids. In this case the &quot;methyl&quot; in the name, which is commonly associated  with  C-17  alpha  alkylated  androgens  like methyltestosterone,     methandrostenolone,     or oxymethoIone, is referring to a modification at C-7. This gives MENT a considerably different appearance than 17- methylnoretestosterone  (Orgasteron).  Of  most  obvious significance  is  its  method  of  use.  Although  perhaps possessing a moderate level of oral bioavailability, this nandroione  derivative  was  not  designed  for  oral administration.  It  is  much  more  effective  when administered to the body directly, by injection, implant, or transdermal gel. In character, MENT is a strongly anabolic steroid, which is accompanied by moderate androgenic and estrogenic properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">General steroid potency is usually increased with<span class="s13"> </span>7-</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">methylation, a trait well illustrated with MENT. When methylation increases steroid potency it is usually due to one  or  a  couple  of  things,  most  notably  increased resistance to hepatic metabolism (breakdown) or reduced affinity for constrictive binding proteins. In the case of MENT, we see a steroid with relatively fast metabolic breakdown, but no binding to SHBG (Sex Hormone- Binding Globulin).<span class="s33">1 </span>Therefore, reduced binding to serum proteins seems to be partly responsible for making MENT a more potent steroid. When assayed in 1963, scientists reported an anabolic effect that was between 3.5 and 23 times greater than testosterone, while being only 3-6 times more androgenic.<span class="s33">2 3  </span>When investigated in primates in 1998, it was shown to have 10 times more anabolic potency  than  testosterone,  with  only  2  times  the stimulatory action on the prostate.<span class="s33">4 </span>Its relative androgen receptor binding affinity was investigated a year later, and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_275.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark858">provided further explanation for the strong anabolic effect of this steroid.

Like a great many of the effective steroids studied during this era, however, MENT didn&#39;t make its way to becoming a commercial drug product. For about four decades it sat gathering dust on the bookshelves, next to many other effective but anonymous compounds. Historically, lack of early financial support has been a death sentence for anabolic steroids. If a company isn&#39;t there in the beginning to spend the millions necessary to develop it into an actual prescription product, it isn&#39;t going to go anywhere later on. The money simply wasn&#39;t there for MENT in the 1960s, and it died. For a long time this agent remained a &quot;nothing&quot; in the world of steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">But things changed for MENT around the turn of the century, in a very dramatic fashion. On October 30, 2000, international drug giant Schering AG (now Bayer) made a public  announcement  that  it  had  entered  into  a partnership  to  research,  develop,  and  market methylnortestosterone   acetate   for   both   male contraceptive  and  hormone  replacement  use.  This followed several years of sporadic but positive studies on this agent.The ball was set in motion, and this old steroid, which scientists had ignored for over thirty years, was suddenly  amidst  a  hotbed  of  new  research  and speculation, the likes of which it had never seen before. In their press release, Schering AG makes promise of a new androgen that offers the anabolic and endocrine benefits of  an  injectable  testosterone,  but  with  less  prostate growth,  and  more  patient  comfort.  In  other  words,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Schering is saying that MENT looks to be an easier to administer and equally useful steroid as testosterone, without the same issues concerning androgenicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The principle attraction Schering/Bayer has to MENT is probably not necessarily its potency, but its ability to duplicate the positive effects of testosterone on muscle mass  and  male  sexual  function  while  minimizing stimulatory action on the prostate. Prostate cancer and benign prostate enlargement are very common problems among males in the U.S., and both diseases are fueled at least partly by androgens. This has led to a great deal of caution when it comes to androgen replacement therapy in  older  men.  Although  the  medical  data  is  still inconclusive in this regard, many physicians fear that the androgenicity of testosterone may lead to ill effects. After all, increases in PSA values with testosterone use in older men are well documented.<span class="s33">7  </span>Perhaps MENT is being introduced to alleviate this concern. Noticing the lower relative androgenicity of MENT, researchers concluded over a decade ago that it might be a far better option for hormone replacement therapy. To quote the researchers from the NY Center for Biomedical Research exactly, &quot;We conclude that the use of MENT instead of T for androgen replacement  therapy  could  have  health-promoting effects by reducing the occurrence of prostate disease.&quot;<span class="s33">8 </span>This is quite a statement, especially when we remember it concerns the use of a synthetic anabolic steroid.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Looking a little more closely at some of the recent studies conducted on MENT, we see a general trend of success and relative safety. Perhaps the most noteworthy to examine is the multinational clinical study that was conducted between 2002 and 2003.<span class="s33">9 </span>It involved the use of MENT implants as long-term contraceptives in males. In this experiment, thirty-six men were enrolled in three separate clinics residing in Germany, Chile, and the Dominical Republic (12 men at each).The study protocols itself called for the use of the implants for 6, 9, or 12 months, and required periodic examinations to measure their effects and potential risks. Three different dosages were used, which consisted of administering one, two, or four implants at the onset of the investigation. Each implant is designed to deliver about 400mcg of steroid per day, which equates to daily doses of ,4mg, ,8mg, or</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">1.6mg of steroid. The release rate is slowly reduced as the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">implant  loses  surface  area,  however,  reaching approximately 200mcg per day by the one-year mark.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The results of the clinical trial were very promising. Four MENT implants (1.6mg/day) suppressed spermatogenesis with  similar  effectiveness  as  testosterone  implants, testosterone  enanthate  injections,  and  testosterone undecanoate  injections  (all  of  which  have  been investigated successfully as contraceptives). MENT was</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">able to produce azoospermia in 82% of treated subjects, a figure that was actually higher than reported with 200 mg of testosterone enanthate per week (which produced azoospermia in 65-66% of normal male subjects by 6 months). As far as negative side effects, they were few.Two subjects noted increases in blood pressure that went outside  the  normal  range,  and  one  was  forced  to discontinue the study because of it (though no ill effect was noted). Otherwise, there was generally just a very small rise in systolic pressure (+4.8), and no significant changes in lipids (including cholesterol and triglycerides) or PSA values. Furthermore, prostate volume was slightly reduced (not increased) in all groups. Liver enzymes were increased slightly, but stayed within the normal range in all subjects. The mean time to the recovery of normal sperm production after discontinuance was 3 months, similar  to  that  reported  in  a  1990  World  Heath Organization study with 200 mg weekly of testosterone enanthate. Overall, MENT performed admirably, with a very notable (acceptable) level of effect, and minimal side effects. And what is more, the drug may be effective when being implanted as infrequently as once per year.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Another study of interest examined the ability of MENT implants to restore sexual behavior and function in hypogonadal (low testosterone) men.<span class="s33">10 </span>This, of course, is one of the principle objectives of androgen replacement therapy. This investigation took place in two clinics, one based in Ireland and the other Hong Kong. Twenty men participated in total, 10 at each location.The study was a double crossover investigation comparing the effects of testosterone enanthate (200 mg every 3 weeks) to that of two MENT implants (delivering ,8mg of drug per day).This means that each of the twenty men had an opportunity to try both drugs, which were taken on two separate occasions  between  washout  periods.  Only  minor differences in response were noted between MENT and conventional androgen replacement therapy, and both drugs were effective in restoring sexual behavior and erection frequency. MENT, at a dosage of 2 implants delivering approximately ,8mg of drug per day, proved to be an effective option for androgen replacement therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">If Bayer does market this drug as an implant, it will be impractical to use for bodybuilding purposes. At best it will need to be broken down and made into an injectable somehow.  The  clinical  study  discussed  above  used implants containing about 140 mg of steroid each. Given the same in a production drug, more than one implant will be  needed  for  a  workable  cycle.  There  is  some investigation into its use as an oral,<span class="s33">11 </span>which does seem feasible (although not ideal from a cost effectiveness standpoint).  The  key  to  this  steroid&#39;s  success  with bodybuilders  will  really  be  the  development  of  a commercial injectable.This will likely follow the release of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bayer&#39;s product; perhaps even precede it.The raw powder is already available from suppliers overseas, so it should not  take  long  for  some  veterinary  or  underground manufacturer to perceive value in this new agent. An acetate version will probably be closely followed by a slower-acting MENT ester, perhaps even something basic like MENT cypionate or MENT enanthate.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark859">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MENT is not yet available as a prescription drug product.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark860">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">MENT is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by the addition of a methyl group at carbon 7-alpha to increase steroid  potency  and  relative  androgenicity.  MENT generally  refers  to  methylnortestosterone  acetate, modified with the addition of carboxylic acid ester (acetic acid) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group to help extend the activity of the steroid during injection or implantation.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark861">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">MENT is aromatized by the body, and converts to a synthetic estrogen with a high level of biological activity (7alpha-methyl-e$tradiol).<span class="s33">12 </span>As a result, it is a moderately estrogenic  steroid.  Gynecomastia  is  possible  during treatment, particularly when higher doses are used. At the same  time  water  retention  can  become a  problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous  water  retention  and  fat  levels  build. Sensitive individuals may want to keep the estrogen under control with the addition of an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective  remedy  for  estrogen  control.  Aromatase inhibitors, however,can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids. Note that there is no mention of gynecomastia in any of the human clinical studies that have been conducted on this agent. Estrogenicity does not appear to be much of a problem when used at appropriate therapeutic dosages.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that studies have also shown MENT to strongly bind the  progesterone  receptor,  as  well  as  to  produce progestational effects on uterine weight in immature rabbits.<span class="s33">13  </span>Further examination, however, confuses this determination. The effects of MENT on uterine weight were not blocked by concurrent use of an anti-progestin (mifepristone) or anti-estrogen, suggesting that neither progestational nor estrogenic activity was responsible for this effect. Given the use of only this one limited model, the known binding of MENT to the progesterone receptor, and the tendency for nandrolone-derived drugs to offer at least some progestational activity, moderate activity will</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be assumed until it can be discounted.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark862">The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to  those  of  estrogen,  including  negative  feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins without excessive estrogen levels being present. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, may be  sufficient  to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by progestational anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss.  Individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of this steroid may find a milder anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin®  to  be  more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that one well-understood function of 7-methylation is to block steroid 5-alpha reduction. As such, this derivative  of  nandrolone  cannot  be  converted  to  a &quot;dihydro&quot; metabolite.<span class="s33">14 </span>With nandrolone and most of its analogs, this reduction means a less androgenic steroid. Dihydronandrolone is weaker than nandrolone, so relative binding is reduced in target tissues with high reductase concentrations. Not being able to convert to a weaker steroid here, MENT is going to display more relative androgenicity  than  nandrolone.  Reductase  inhibitors, likewise, will not affect the relative androgenicity of MENT. Greater  androgenicity  was  deemed  a  desirable  trait during development, as it allows MENT to more effectively support male sex characteristics and libido compared to the weakly androgenic nandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark863">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">MENT is not a d 7-alpha alkylated compound, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark864">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.

The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. MENT is likely to have a moderate effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its aromatizable nature and route of administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark865">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

For simplicity, this might mean using  it  with  drugs  like  testosterone  cypionate  or enanthate (200-400 mg per week), Dianabol (20-35 mg per day),or Anadrol (50-100 mg per day) when looking for sheer size, milder anabolics like nandrolone decanoate or boldenone undecylenate (200-400 mg per week) for lean mass, or non-aromatizable drugs like Primobolan (200- 400 mg per week), Winstrol (20-35 mg per day), or Anavar (15-20 mg per day) while cutting.

Looking  <span style=" color: #393939;">at  </span>the structure of this steroid, we see it is basically just testosterone with an added methyl group at the c-1<span style=" color: #393939;">7 </span>alpha position (a c-17 alpha alkylated substance), which allows for  oral  administration.  The  resultant  compound &quot;methylated-testosterone&quot; was among the first functional oral steroids to be produced. This field of research has consequently improved greatly over the years, and today methyltestosterone is quite crude in comparison to many of the other orals that were subsequently developed. The action  of  this  steroid  is  moderately  anabolic  and androgenic,  with  high  estrogenic  activity  due  to  its aromatization to 17-alpha methyl estradiol. This generally makes methyltestosterone too troublesome (in terms of estrogenic  side  effects)  to  use  for  muscle-building purposes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark870">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone was first described in 1935,<span class="s33">1 </span>and was one of the first oral androgens to be used in clinical medicine (it follows Proviron, the first oral androgen, by one year). Its main clinical use at the time of development was as an oral medication to replace testosterone (and its anabolic  and/or  androgenic  activity)  in  males  when endogenous  levels  were  insufficient  (Andropause), although the drug was adopted for a number of other uses over the years as well. These include the treatment of cryptorchidism (undescended testicles), breast cancer in postmenopausal women, excessive lactation and breast pain after pregnancy in mothers not nursing, osteoporosis, and, more recently, female menopause (supporting the overall energy and sexual interest of the patient).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In  addition  to  standard  tablets  and  capsules, methyltestosterone has also been commercially prepared in sublingual or buccal tablets. Metandren Linguets from Ciba Pharmaceutical Company were perhaps the most</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="159" alt="image" src="img/Image_278.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">recognized, and were popularly sold from the 1950&#39;s to 1990&#39;s. These tablets were placed under the tongue or between the gum and cheek and left to dissolve, delivering the  drug  to  circulation  via  the  mucous  membranes, bypassing  the  liver.  Sublingual  or  buccal  intake approximately   doubles   the   bioavailability   of methyltestosterone, and also provides peak levels of drug rapidly (approximately 1 hour after dosing instead of 2 hours). Although Ciba&#39;s Metandren Linguets are no longer commercially available, numerous other sublingual/buccal methyltestosterone tablets are still in production today.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark871">Methyltestosterone  remains  a  controversial  steroid. Although it has a long history, and arguably a justifiable safety record, it is no longer widely used, and is even being withdrawn  from  many  drug  markets.  The  German Endocrine  Society  made  an  official  statement  that methyltestosterone was obsolete in 1981, and the drug would be removed from German pharmacies some seven years later. Most European nations followed suit. The drug remains available in the United States, although most clinicians generally find it to be a poor choice and don&#39;t prescribe it. Its potential hepatotoxicity is usually cited as a reason, especially when long-term androgen therapy is contemplated.The one exception seems to be the growing interest in using oral methyltestosterone in low doses to treat female menopause. Early success with Estratest (Solvay) seems to indicate future expansion for this application. Although many markets no longer produce this  drug,  especially  as  a  single-ingredient  product, methyltestosterone  remains  widely  produced  in  many others.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark872">Methyltestosterone is widely available in human drug markets.

Gynecomastia is often a concern during treatment, and may present itself quite early into a cycle (particularly when higher doses are used). At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build.To avoid strong estrogenic side effects, it may be necessary to use an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®.  One  may  alternately  use  an  aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective  remedy  for  estrogen  control.  Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone  is  classified  as  an  androgen. Androgenic side effects are common with this substance, and may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Higher doses are more likely to cause such side  effects.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also aggravate male pattern hair loss.Those genetically prone to male pattern hair loss may wish to opt for a milder, less androgenic, anabolic steroid. As a potent androgen, this steroid may also increase aggressiveness. Women are additionally warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.  Like  testosterone,  methyltestosterone converts to a more potent steroid via interaction with the 5-alpha  reductase  enzyme,  in  this  case  17-alpha- methyldihydrotestosterone.The  relative  androgenicity  of methyltestosterone  may  be  reduced,  although  not completely  eliminated,  by  the  concurrent  use  of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">into the bloodstream following oral administration. 07- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of c17-afpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone was the first oral steroid linked to hepatic damage. This may be, in part, related to the early widespread use of the compound, as the drug generally displays  acceptable  safety  when  used  in  clinically prescribed  dosages  (serious  liver  toxicity  cannot  be completely excluded, however, even at clinical doses). When taken at a dose of 30 mg daily for 5 weeks, hepatotoxicity, as measured by bromosulphalein (BSP) retention,  was  low  in  one  study.<span class="s33">2  </span>In  a  separate investigation, a majority of patients noticed significant BSP retention after only 2 weeks of therapy with 67mg daily.<span class="s33">3  </span>Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic  nature  in  which  most  people  use  oral anabolic/androgenic  steroids,  although  cannot  be excluded with methyltestosterone, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">use </span>of <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark875">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown and route of administration. Studies have demonstrated an approximate 35% decrease in HDL cholesterol and a 30% increase in LDL cholesterol with 40 mg per day.<span class="s33">4 </span>These changes occurred within 2-4 weeks of the initiation of therapy, and persisted for 2 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark876">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The dose is reduced by 50% when administered in sublingual or buccal form.The drug would be used for extended periods so long as the patent&#39;s laboratory results (hepatotoxicity, serum lipids, etc.) do not necessitate its discontinuance. When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, a daily dosage of 10-50 mg is most commonly used, taken in cycles  lasting  no  more  than  6-8  weeks  in  length. Methyltestosterone is most commonly used not as an anabolic,  but  to  stimulate  aggression  in  the  user. Powerlifters, bodybuilders, and competitive athletes often attempt to harness this effect, looking for extra intensity in a  training  session  or  competition.  Aside  from  this, methyltestosterone offers little except side effects. It is quite toxic, elevating liver enzymes and causing acne, gynecomastia,  aggression,  and  water  retention  quite easily.  Were  one  to  tolerate  these  side  effects, methyltestosterone will offer only poor quality (bulky)</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyltestosterone is generally not recommended for women  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes  due  to  its  strong  androgenic  nature  and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark880">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Pharmaceutical      preparations      containing methyltestosterone are fairly limited.

The drug itself is manufactured in two very distinct forms.The first is unesterified (straight) methylandrostenediol, which is used when making an oral medication with this steroid (although an injectable once existed in the U.S.). It is also found  as  esterified  methylandrostenediol  dipropionate, which is prepared as an injectable. The added propionate esters in the injectable form extend the activity of the drug for several days. Basically, methandriol drugs are altered c-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">17 alkylated forms of 5-androstenediol. Methandriol is classified as a weak anabolic with weak androgenic properties. It also seems to display some level of estrogenic activity, making this steroid less ideal for dieting.The drug is generally considered too mild, and is not widely popular among bodybuilders and athletes. Sometimes, however, it is used in place of other anabolic/androgenic agents in bulking stacks when available.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methylandrostenediol  was  first  described  in  1935,<span class="s50">6351 </span>making this a very old agent as far as synthetic anabolic steroids  are  concerned.  Methylandrostendiol  was developed into a medicine by Organon, which sold it in the United States under the Stenediol brand name in both oral (methylandrostenediol)       and       injectable (methylandrostendiol  dipropionate)  forms.  Many  other generics and other brands of methylandrostenediol soon followed, and the drug was a popular anabolic agent in the United States during the 1950&#39;s. Methylandrostenediol was essentially the first steroid perceived to have a notable separation of anabolic (higher) and androgenic (lower) effect, a persistent goal of pharmaceutical developers. Early product literature described it as, &quot;a steroid which has considerable of the male hormone&#39;s tissue-building action without to the same extent causing virilization.&#39;&#39;<span class="s33">6362 </span>It was indicated for use as a, &quot;tissue-builder in cases of retarded</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="159" alt="image" src="img/Image_283.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">growth or failure to gain weight accompanied by protein wastage, negative nitrogen balance, or failure <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>build body proteins.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark883">Early  assessments  of  methylandrostenediol  being primarily anabolic in nature did not hold up well with later extensive use in humans. It was eventually determined that in doses sufficient to promote weight gain, its anabolic properties were accompanied by significant androgenic activity. Ultimately, this drug would be viewed as one of balanced anabolic and androgenic action, not as a highly anabolic agent as originally thought. Organon would go on to develop more effective anabolic agents, such as their 19- nor series of drugs including Durabolin, Deca-Durabolin, and Maxibolin, and eventually discontinued the Stenediol products. The other U.S. brand and generic forms of the drug would follow as well, although methylandrostenediol would persist in the U.S. scene for some time. Currently, no domestic source of the drug exists, although it is still found in certain international markets. It seems most prominent in Australia at the present time, where it remains included in a number of veterinary anabolic steroid products.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark884">Methylandrostendiol is available in select human and veterinary drug markets.

Methlyandrostenediol is also believed to have some inherent estrogenic activity. It is, likewise, considered a weakly to moderately estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia is possible  during  treatment,  but  generally  only  when higher doses are used. Water and fat retention can also become issues, again depending on dose. Sensitive individuals may need to addition an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex® to minimize related side effects.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark887">Although  often  classified  as  an  anabolic  steroid, methylandrostenediol   is   sufficiently   androgenic. Androgenic side effects are common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair  growth.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the  potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth,   and   clitoral   enlargement.   Note   that methylandrostenediol  is  not  affected  by  5-alpha reductase, so the relative androgenicity of this steroid is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methylandrostenediol is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. Cl 7- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.

For  physique-  or performance-enhancing purposes, a typical dosage is in the range of 25-50 mg daily for the oral form, and 200-400 mg per week with the injectable. In order to keep blood levels more even with the injectable, it is generally administered once every three to four days. Cycles generally last for no more than 6 to 8 weeks, in an effort to minimize hepatotoxicity and strain on the liver and cholesterol values. This level of use is sufficient for moderate gains in muscle size and strength, which may be accompanied by a low level&#39;of water retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">While it may be possible to use methylandrostenediol alone for muscle-building purposes, it is most often combined with other anabolics for a stronger effect. Combined  with  Deca-Durabolin®  or  Equipoise®,  for example, measurable gains of hard muscle mass, without an extreme level of water retention, may be noticed.This is the general composition of most Australian vet blends that include methylandrostenediol. When looking for a more pronounced gain in mass, a stronger androgen such as testosterone may be added. The resulting growth can be quite exceptional, but the user will also have to deal with a much stronger set of estrogenic side effects. The drug sometimes also combines well with non-aromatizing anabolics such as Winstrol®, Primobolan®, or oxandrolone. The result here should be a more pronounced effect on muscle hardness, with a moderate gain of solid lean tissue.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark892">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Early prescribing guidelines for Stenediol recommend a dosage of 25 mg given 2 to 5 times per week by oral, buccal, or intramuscular route.

What was produced was a steroid with  minimal  anabolic  effect  and  low  to  moderate androgenic activity, far removed from its 7-alpha isomer cousin  (bolasterone)  in  overall  appearance.

It is closest in structure to 1-testosterone (dihydroboldenone), differing only by the addition of c-17 alkylation (which does change the activity of this steroid considerably). MIT for short, this agent can be looked at as some </a><span style=" color: #393939;">kind </span>of amalgamation of Primobolan, Winstrol, and trenbolone. It has  the  basic  1-ene  structure  of  Primobolan,  the bioavailability of a methylated oral steroid like Winstrol, and the high potency of a strong synthetic anabolic and androgenic agent like trenbolone. Based on standard assays,  the  potency  of  methyl-1-testosterone  actually exceeds  that  of  every  prescription  anabolic  steroid currently sold. It is popular among bodybuilders as a bulking agent, with an ability to promote rapid gains in muscle size and strength, which are often accompanied by some level of water or fat retention.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyl-1-testosterone was first described in 1962.<span class="s33">1 </span>This compound was developed during some of the most active years of steroid research, a time when literally hundreds of different effective anabolic agents were being actively studied  and  pursued  by  drug  companies.  Although methyl-1-testosterone did see some favorable assays, displaying a high level of potency and an acceptable ratio of  anabolic  to  androgenic  effect,  like  most  agents synthesized during this time period it never actually developed into a medicine. As is common in many areas of pharmaceutical research, a select number of agents were given the dollars for full studies and eventual release, and the rest were ignored. Methyl-1-testosteroe, for whatever reason, was simply not one of the select few drugs to reach pharmacy shelves, and it lay dormant in the medical books for approximately forty years.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Methyl-1-testosterone reemerged sharply in 2003, when it was introduced as an OTC (Over-The-Counter) &quot;nutritional</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_291.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">supp!ement&quot;ln the United States, due to the fact that it was unknown when the 1991 law controlling anabolic steroids was written, and therefore not included. The product was introduced to the market by Legal Gear, and was soon extremely  popular  due  to  its  very  high  level  of effectiveness. It was also soon the subject of many generic copies. Methyl-1-testosterone did not last long in the U.S., and laws were soon passed to include it as a controlled substance. The laws went into effect January 20, 2005, at which point the possession or distribution of this steroid started carrying the same Federal penalties as other anabolic steroids. This effectively ended the market for methyl-1-testosterone, and the agent is again unavailable to bodybuilders worldwide.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark908">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark909">No  prescription  drug  product  containing  methyl-1- testosterone currently exists.

It contains 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the introduction of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, which helps to stabilize the 3-keto  group  and  increase  the  steroid&#39;s  anabolic properties.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although not studied, it is believed that the body does not appreciably aromatize methyl-1-testosterone. It is of note, however, that this steroid likely has inherent progestational activity.The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient <span style=" color: #393939;">to  </span>mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by  progestational anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark911">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Its low relative androgenicity could theoretically make this preparation acceptable to women, although (in practice) not its very high potency. Although methyl-1 -testosterone is primarily anabolic in nature, strong androgenic side effects are possible with higher doses, and should be carefully considered. Note that the 5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize methyl-1-testosterone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark912">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Methyl-1-testosterone  is  a  cl  7-alpha  alkylated compound.  This  alteration  protects  the  drug  from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17-alpha alkylated anabolic/androgenic steroids can be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver damage. In rare instances life­ threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark913">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Although not extensively studied in humans, the oral route, high relative potency,  and  poorly  or  non-aromatizable  nature  <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>methyl-1-testosterone  suggest  that  this  agent  is extremely prone to negatively altering lipid values and increasing atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark914">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark915">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">2 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark916">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyl-1-Testosterone was never approved for use in humans.  Prescribing  guidelines  are  unavailable.  For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, a typical effective oral daily dose will be in the range of 5-10 mg, taken for no longer than 4-6 weeks. A dose of 20 mg is sometimes used,although this increases the likelihood for</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark917">side effects. Many users feel they are better served by not exceeding a 10 mg daily dose, and instead stack it with an injectable like testosterone cypionate (200-400 mg per week) when a stronger effect is needed.This may reduce liver toxicity compared to </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">a </span>higher dose of M1T, and also provide a more balanced cycle in terms of anabolic vs. androgenic effect. A common complaint when MIT is taken alone is lethargy, which may be due, in part, to its low androgenic or estrogenic component. Stacking it with an aromatizable androgen like testosterone will usually alleviate this problem. Note that while a small percentage of users exceed 20 mg per day, it should be remembered that even this is a serious dose for a potent steroid like this, and is not  to be taken lightly,  either for its effectiveness  or  toxicity.  Like  Anadrol,  methyl-1  - testosterone is not necessarily a friendly steroid, but it is definitely an effective one.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyl-1-Testosterone was never approved for use in humans.

It is a nandrolone-based compound, modified to be orally active and to have greatly increased anabolic properties. Methyldienolone is a close chemical cousin of methyltrienolone, one of the strongest steroids profiled in this reference. MethyldienoIone is not quite as potent, however it remains quite strong next to most commercial agents. Animal tests find it to be 5 times more potent  than  Dianabol,  10  times  more  potent  than methyltestosterone,  and  13  times  more  potent  than Primobolan® on a milligram for milligram basis. Although the  real  world  relevance  of  these  values  may  be questionable,  methyldienolone  is  well  favored  by bodybuilders for its ability to promote lean muscle gains with minimal side effects.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldienolone was first described in 1960.<span class="s33">1 </span>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. (U.S.) developed this steroid, although the firm never released it as an actual medicine. It is of note that Lilly also developed a 17-alpha-ethylated version (ethyldienolone) at the same time, which had an even more favorable anabolic to androgenic ratio in standard assay tests, but was  not  quite  as  potent  overall.  Being  that methyldienolone was never sold as a prescription drug, it remained  a  research  steroid  of  little  interest  for approximately forty years.The steroid actually came to life not as a prescription agent, but as an OTC &quot;nutritional supplement&quot; in 2004. Bruce Kneller,who had found the old research on methyldienolone and determined it to be a favorable agent to market with Gaspari Nutrition, was actually credited with developing the product. Gaspari sold the agent for a brief time as Methyl-D, before the 2004 amended  Anabolic  Steroid  Control  Act  was  passed, eliminating  much  of  the  grey  area  &quot;prohormone&quot;  or &quot;prosteroid&quot; market in the U.S. Today, methyldienolone is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark920">again unavailable to athletes.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark921">Methyldienolone is not available as a commercial agent.

It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the introduction of a double bond at carbon 9, which  increases  its  binding  affinity  and  slows  its metabolism. The resulting steroid is significantly more potent than its nandrolone base, and displays a much longer  half-life  and  lower  affinity  for  serum-binding proteins in comparison.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark922">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldienolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. It is of note, however, that based on its structure methyldienoIone likely displays significant binding affinity for the progesterone receptor . The side effects associated with progesterone can be similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth.There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused  by  progestational  anabolic/androgenic  steroids. Note that significant side effects are not likely unless high doses are taken, or the drug is used with other strongly aromatizable steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark923">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark924">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance.

Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, the 5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize methyldienolone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldienolone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound.This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl  7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction  may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Note that given its high level of  potency  and  close  structural  similarity  to methyltrienolone, one of the most hepatotoxic steroids known, methyldienolone is likely also very hepatotoxic; liver strain should be carefully monitored with use.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark925">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Although not studied in humans, the high relative potency, oral route, and  non-aromatizable  nature  of  methydienolone suggests that this agent is extremely prone to negatively altering lipid  values and increasing atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark926">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark927">The above side effects are not inclusive.

In an effort to reduce liver strain, it is usually recommended to limit drug duration to no longer than 6- 8 weeks, after which point a break is taken from all c-17 alkylated steroids. Users often avoid combining this drug with other liver toxic orals, and instead opt to use an injectable base when stacking.

This agent is a derivative of trenbolone  (trienolone),  which  has  been  c-17  alpha alkylated to allow for oral administration.This modification has created a steroid that is significantly stronger than its non-methylated cousin. Its potency has been measured to be anywhere from 120-300 times greater than that of methyltestosterone,  with  greater  dissociation  between anabolic and androgenic effects.<span class="s33">1 2 </span>Milligram for milligram methyltrienolone is a more active steroid than any agent sold on the commercial market, requiring doses as little as</p><p style="padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark932">.5-1 milligram per day to notice a strong anabolic effect.

In spite of its high relative activity, however, methyltrienolone has seen very limited use in humans. It was used clinically during the late 1960&#39;s and early &#39;70&#39;s, most notably in the treatment of advanced breast   cancer.   Here,   its   exceedingly   strong anabolic/androgenic action helps the drug counter the local effects of endogenous estrogens, lending it some efficacy for slowing or even regressing tumor growth. Such application was not long lived, however, as more realistic evaluations  of  the  drug&#39;s  toxicity  soon  led  to  its abandonment in human medicine.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">By the mid-1970&#39;s, methyltrienolone was becoming an accepted  standard  in  non-human  research  studies, particularly those pertaining to the study of the androgen receptor activity. For this purpose the agent is very well suited. Its sheer potency and resistance to serum-binding proteins makes it an excellent in-vitro receptor-binding</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">standard to compare other agents to. Being so resistant to metabolism, active methyltrienolone metabolites are also not going to greatly interfere with the results <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>most experiments. Body tissues can metabolize most steroids fairly easily, which means that even incubation studies can be complicated with the question of what is causing <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>particular effect, the steroid or one of its unidentified metabolites.  This  is  much  less  of  an  issue  with methyltrienolone.  Speaking  to  its  utility  in  laboratory experiments, methyltrienolone is still widely used for this purpose today.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark933">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark934">Methyltrienolone is not available as a commercial agent.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark935">Methyltrienolone is a modified form of nandrolone.

This agent is moderately anabolic, with only mild androgenic properties.This is no doubt due to the modification of the steroid&#39;s A-ring, which allows the steroid structure to remain stable and bind receptors in muscle tissue long enough to provide an anabolic benefit. Dihydrotestosterone, in comparison, is a poor anabolic, quickly  metabolized  in  muscle  tissue  to  inactive metabolites. The gains associated with furazabol are not extreme, and would more closely resemble the quality growth of a mild non-aromatizing anabolic like stanozolol or  drostanolone,  instead  of  the  watery  bulk  of  a testosterone. For this reason, furazabol is most often applied during cutting phases of training, and by athletes in speed and weight-restricted sports.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark946">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furazabol was first described in 1965.&#39; The only modern pharmaceutical  preparation  of  record  containing furazabol, at least known to researchers in the West, was Miotolan from Daiichi Seiyaku Labs in Japan, which was sold in Japan mainly during the 1970&#39;s and &#39;80&#39;s.The agent itself  is  scarcely  mentioned  in  the  Western  medical literature, and consequently a great deal of myth has come to surround it among athletes. A realistic appraisal sits this agent in a very similar class to stanozolol, however, with both agents being moderately strong anabolics with low androgenic activity. Aside from this, it is difficult to ascribe any drastically unique traits to this drug.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furazabol was a popular steroid among Olympic athletes during the 1980&#39;s, when it was quietly known among certain trainers that testing officials had not yet identified the agent, and therefore could not test for it. Dr. Jamie Astaphan,the physician that accompanied Ben Johnson to the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, reportedly was giving Johnson (and numerous other athletes at the time) furazabol, knowing the drug would not be detectable.

Within two years, methods for the detection of furazabol in urine were published, immediately eliminating any value this agent formerly possessed as a steroid undetectable to drug screeners.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark947">Today, furazabol is very scarcely known to bodybuilders. The Miotolan brand from Japan was discontinued many years ago, and no pharmaceutical preparation containing furazabol has been known to exist since. The drug is occasionally located on the black market, however, due to the fact that is it still produced in bulk (as a raw material for product manufacturing) in Asia. From there it is obtained by underground steroid manufacturing operations in the West,  and  produced  into  oral  tablets  and  capsules. Currently  the  actual  number  of  products  containing furazabol is small, although could easily be expanded if market demand for the agent increases. It remains unlikely that an actual prescription product containing this steroid will ever be seen again.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Furazabol is no longer available as a prescription drug preparation. When sold it came in the form of tablets containing 1mg of steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark948">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furazabol is a modified form of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17- alpha,  which  helps  protect  the  hormone  during  oral administration, and 2) the attachment of a furazan group to the A-ring, replacing the normal 3-keto group. When viewed in the light of 17-alpha methyldihydrotestosterone, the  A-ring  modification  on  furazabol  seems  to considerably increase its anabolic strength while reducing its relative androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark949">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark950">Furazabol is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark951">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Furazabol </a><span style=" color: #393939;">is </span>a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone. Note that furazabol is unaffected by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furazabol  is  a  cl7-alpha  alkylated  compound.  This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl  7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark952">The use of </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Furazabol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its non-aromatizable nature, structural resistance to  liver  breakdown,  and  route  of  administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that furazabol is often mistakenly described as a steroid  with  unique  beneficial  cholesterol-lowering effects. Such statements usually make reference of studies conducted in the early 1970&#39;s, which examined the lipid- lowering effects of the agent.<span class="s33">2 </span>Such a position, however, lacks a modern perspective of the drug.To draw a parallel, during the early 1970&#39;s there was research done on oxandrolone,  demonstrating  a  lipid-lowering  effect.<span class="s33">3 </span>Upon closer inspection, however, it was shown that oxandrolone  tends  to  lower  HDL  (good)  cholesterol, increasing  the  HDL-LDL  ratio  and  atherogenic  risk. General cholesterol-lowering applications for the drug never materialized. The same is true for furazabol. Some have gone so far as to recommend this steroid to those with high cholesterol! Such use absolutely should be avoided.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark953">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

This agent is orally active and non-aromatizable, with a profile somewhat similar to that of  Winstrol  or  Anavar  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">-  </span>primarily  anabolic,  with  no discernable estrogenic activity. According to early assay results,  methylhydroxynandrolone  is  13  times  more anabolic than methyltestosterone, with approximately<span class="s13"> </span>3</p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">times greater androgenicity. Although animal assay data doesn&#39;t translate perfectly to humans, it remains clear that MOHN  is  considerably  stronger  on  a  milligram  for milligram basis than the common prescription steroids. MOHN is also a bit more androgenic than the assay data conveys, and behaves slightly more like trenbolone than nandroione  in  this  regard.  Its  4-hydroxyl  group,  a modification that prevents its 5-alpha reduction in humans to weaker &quot;dihydro” metabolites in the skin, scalp and prostate,  intensifies  the  relative  androgenicity  of  this steroid. Athletes favor it for lean gains in muscle mass, strength, and performance, with minimal side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methylhydroxynandrolone  was  first  described  in  1964, developed during a series of investigations that looked at the  effects  of  4-hydroxylation  on  various  nandroione compounds.<span class="s33">1 </span>Being that 4-hydroxylation inhibits 5-alpha reduction, nandroione derivatives with this alteration tend to be more androgenic. They are, therefore, less likely to cause side effects relating to low libido and reduced androgenicity, common with injectable nandroione esters. Although    early    results    showed    that methylhydroxynandrolone  was  both  effective  and retained a favorable ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect, it was ultimately never developed into a medicine. Only MOHN&#39;s non-methylated cousin, oxabolone (as oxabolone cypionate), had reached the stage of prescription drug product. For approximately forty years after its synthesis, little mention was made of methylhydroxynandrolone in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_300.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">the medical literature. For all intents and purposes, it was a dead and forgotten anabolic steroid.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">MOHN  suddenly  reemerged  in  2004,  when  it  was introduced  as  a  &quot;nutritional  product&quot;  on  the  U.S. supplement market. It was being sold OTC, without the restrictions of a synthetic anabolic steroid. This was due primarily to the fact that it was never regulated as a drug <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>the U.S., and barring <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>direct listing in the 1991 Anabolic Steroid Control Act, could not be covered by it. Its legality as a supplement may have been questionable, but that was a matter for the FDA to handle, not the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). MOHN has since been included in the most recent expansion of U.S. anabolic steroid laws, however,  and  formally  became  a  controlled  anabolic steroid on January 20,2005. Possession of this agent after this date carries all the same legal risks and consequences as other popular and illegal steroids according to Federal law. Due to the fact that it is not a prescription drug, this law  effectively  marked  the  commercial  end  of methylhydroxynandrolone products.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Methylhydroxynandrolone is not available as a commercial agent. When sold as a nutritional supplement, it generally contained 3mg of steroid per tablet.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methylhydroxynandrolone  is  a  modified  form  of nandroione. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the introduction of a hydroxyl group at carbon 4, which inhibits aromatization, progestational activity,and 5-alpha reduction, and reduces relative steroid androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Methylhydroxynandrolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. Estrogenic side effects</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark957">such  as  increased  water  retention,  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia are not likely to occur with use. The non- estrogenic  nature  of  methylhydroxynandrolone  makes this agent favorable during cutting or lean mass phases of training, when muscle definition is favored over raw bulk gains.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark958">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, the 5-alpha reductase   enzyme   does   not   metabolize methylhydroxynandrolone, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Methylhydroxynandrolone  is  a  d  7-alpha  alkylated compound.  This  alteration  protects  the  drug  from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17-alpha alkylated anabolic/androgenic steroids can be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver damage. In rare instances life­ threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark959">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Although not studied in humans, the high relative potency, oral route, and      non-aromatizable      nature      of methylhydroxynandrolone  suggest  that  this  agent  is extremely prone to negatively altering lipid values and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">increasing atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark960">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark961">The above side effects are not inclusive.

However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">2 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark962">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methylhydroxynandrolone was never approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable. Effective oral daily doses for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes fall in the range of 2-10 mg. In an effort to reduce liver strain, it is usually recommended to limit drug duration to no longer than 6-8 weeks, after which point a break is taken from all c-17 alkylated steroids. At this level MOHN should provide very solid gains in lean muscle mass and strength, without water retention or increased fat deposition. MOHN is not thought of as a bulking drug itself, although is very versatile for stacking, and mixes well with many other anabolics depending on the individual goals of the user.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark963">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark964">Methylhydroxynandrolone was never approved for use in humans.

It differs only by the addition of a methyl group at c-7, which accounts for its given chemical name, 7,17-dimethyltestosterone. The added c-7 methyl group makes the activity of this steroid far removed from methyltestosterone,  however,  such  that  any  direct comparison is difficult to justify. For starters, bolasterone is a fairly potent steroid, measured in human subjects to have approximately   twice   the   anabolic   effect   of methandrostenolone.<span class="s33">1   </span>This   is   in   contrast   to methyltestosterone, which is considerably less potent than methandrostenolone.  Despite  being  a  testosterone derivative, bolasterone is also much more anabolic than androgenic in nature. At a given therapeutic level, it is much less likely to cause androgenic/virilizing side effects. It does have one strong similarity to methyltestosterone, however, which lies in the fact that bolasterone too is quite estrogenic. Both agents are, therefore, most appropriately used during bulking phases or training.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark967">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bolasterone was first described in 1959.<span class="s33">2 </span>It was closely evaluated  for  anabolic  and  androgenic  effect approximately 3 years later.<span class="s33">3 </span>The drug was developed by Upjohn, and sold in the U.S. during the 1960&#39;s under the Myagen brand name. It was mainly indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women, although the agent was also investigated for its stimulatory effect on blood cells and its general anabolic (lean-tissue sparing) activity. Bolasterone was ultimately a short-lived drug, disappearing from the U.S. market shortly after its release. By the 1980&#39;s, bolasterone had been out of commerce for so long that it was all but forgotten among athletes. Although bolasterone is no longer produced, the drug remains listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeias, suggesting it would not be impossible to see this agent for sale (legally) in the U.S. again, perhaps under order by a private</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><table style="border-collapse:collapse" cellspacing="0"><tr style="height:25pt"><td style="width:244pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" colspan="2" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Chemical Names <span class="s209">17beta-Hydroxy-7,17alpha-dimethylandrost-4-en-3-one</span></p><p class="s209" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">7,17-dimethyltestosterone</p></td></tr><tr style="height:14pt"><td style="width:133pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Estrogenic Activity</p></td><td style="width:111pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt"><p class="s160" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">high</p></td></tr><tr style="height:16pt"><td style="width:133pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s103" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Progestational Activity</p></td><td style="width:111pt;border-top-style:solid;border-top-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-bottom-width:1pt" bgcolor="#FCFCFC"><p class="s161" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-right: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">no data available</p></td></tr></table><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">compounding pharmacy.

Gynecomastia  may  be  a  concern  during treatment,especially when higher than normal therapeutic doses are used. At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build. To avoid strong estrogenic side effects, it may be necessary to use an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective remedy for estrogen control. Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite  expensive  in  comparison  to  standard  estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark971">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although bolasterone is classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic  side  effects  are  still  possible  with  this substance.These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Higher doses are more likely to cause such side effects. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also  aggravate  male  pattern  hair  loss.  Women  are additionally warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement. Bolasterone is unaffected by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected  by  the  concurrent  use  of  finasteride  or dutasteride. Note that studies administering 1mg and 2mg of bolasterone per day have shown no outward androgenic   side   effects   in   children   and hypogonadotrophic males, as would be characterized by public hair growth, genital changes, voice changes, and acne. Higher doses remain likely to induce androgenic effects. Bolasterone is considered to have a comparable ratio of anabolic to androgenic effect as oxymethoIone and methandrostenolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Bolasterone is <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Studies administering 1mg and 2mg of bolasterone daily for 6 weeks to 27 patients have demonstrated a trend toward increases in serum alkaline phosphatase (a marker of liver stress), although</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: justify;">no  significant  untoward  effects  on  the  liver  were</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Bolasterone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown and route  of  administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction. Studies administering 1mg and 2mg of bolasterone daily for 6 weeks to 27 patients have demonstrated a trend toward increased serum cholesterol. Although no HDL and LDL breakdown was provided, it can be assumed based on the structure and route of administration that bolasterone significantly shifted the ratio of these two fractions of cholesterol  further  apart,  measurably  increasing atherogenic risk.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark973">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

It  contains  a  mixture  of  methandriol dipropionate and nandrolone cypionate, the two steroids present in a concentration of 45 mg/mL and 30 mg/mL respectively.This adds up to a total of 75 mg per milliliter of steroid, or 750 mg total each 10 mL multi-dose vial.These two agents are primarily anabolic in nature, and tend to provide the user a good ratio of muscle growth to androgenic/estrogenic side effects. Methandriol does carry some inherent estrogenicity, however, which makes this product  less  than  perfectly  suited for  drastic cutting phases.  Athletes  do  not  generally  view  this  steroid preparation as a bulking drug, but instead value its as a lean-tissue-building drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark979">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The Nandrabolin formulation was originally developed by Jurox, a company with a 30-year history of manufacturing veterinary drugs in Australia. It is designed to improve the muscularity of racehorses, as well as provide benefits of maintaining a proper fluid balance and aid the digestion and assimilation of dietary protein. Jurox voluntarily scaled back its line of steroid products considerably in early 2001 (this formulation included), amidst a great deal of public controversy concerning their exportation of high volumes of steroids to Mexico (known to feed the American black market). Although the exact relationship between the companies is unknown, many of the discontinued Jurox products were registered under the SYD Group label in August 2002. Nandrabolin was among them, and has been sold by SYD Group exclusively ever since. It would be marketed under the new trade name Anabolic NA.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">SYD Group had initially marketed many of its products heavily in Mexico, even producing distinct formulations and labeling to compete in the then very competitive market. Anabolic NA did not appear to be one of them, however, likely due to the low concentration and perceived</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark980">low value. SYD Group had also acquired Grupo Comercial Tarasco around this time, a company that was formed several years ago specifically to import Jurox products into Mexico.  Things  changed  rapidly  in  December  2005, however, when U.S. authorities spearheaded Operation Gear Grinder, which targeted many companies operating in Mexico (SYD Group included) for providing steroid products to illegal American importers. The firm quickly discontinued the sale of all anabolic steroid products in Mexico, and stated they will no longer produce high- concentration anabolics which entice abuse. The Anabolic NA product remains available in Australia, although given tight controls is not commonly diverted to the black market.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark981">Anabolic NA is available on the Australian veterinary drug market.

Given  the  relatively  low  per  ML  steroid concentration, this drug is often used in a low dose, and stacked with other agents for a stronger effect. Given the mild estrogenicity already present with methandriol, this is often an agent with low or no estrogenic properties.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark988">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Nandrabolin has not been approved for use in humans.

This is the active drug that is used in Andriol, but in that case it is part of an oral medication, not an injectable. Nebido is being  marketed  as  a  replacement  for  established injectable testosterone products like Delatestryl®, Depo- Testosterone®, and Sustanon®, which are actually much faster acting in comparison. It is designed to offer a much less frequent injection schedule, and, therefore, much greater comfort for the patient. Nebido is </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a drug </span>developed under a similar focus as testosterone buciclate, which is another very slow-acting injectable ester <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>testosterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Nebido® was developed by international giant Schering AG, Germany (now Bayer). It first surfaced as a prescription drug in Finland and Germany in October and November <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>2004, respectively. Within a year it had been approved <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>sale throughout Europe. Schering/Bayer <span style=" color: #393939;">has </span>since also brought this product to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, <span style=" color: #393939;">South </span>Africa, Colombia, Korea, Venezuela, a nd various countries in Eastern Europe (86 countries in total). In July 2005, the U.S. pharmaceuticals firm Indevus purchased the rights to market Nebido under the Aveed trade name.The FDA has since held up U.S. approval of the drug, however, focusing on a small number of adverse reports in Germany. These specifically involve post-injection anaphylactic reactions and pulmonary oil microembolism. Most of these reactions are likely not due to a problem with the drug itself, but incorrect  administration  of  the  high-volume  injection. Future approval in the U.S. is expected, but unclear.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nebido® was described by Schering <span style=" color: #393939;">as </span>being the, &quot;first long-acting  injection  for  the  treatment  of  male hypogonadism.&quot; This may be a matter of perspective, as other slow-acting esters do exist. Schering, however, is taking the lead to market in most regions.The applications for Nebido® are extremely narrow, being approved for use in men as a long-term treatment option for low androgen</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_308.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">levels only. It is not labeled for use in women, or in males for other uses. Given the growing acceptance of androgen replacement therapy, and the comfort advantage that Nebido®  seems  to  offer  male  hormone  replacement therapy patients (esters like enanthate and cypionate generally require between 13 and 26 injections per year), it may very well become a dominant testosterone product in the years to come, especially with the marketing support of a pharmaceutical giant like Bayer.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark992">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone undecanoate (injection) is available in various human drug markets. All products (Nebido®) contain 250 mg/ml of steroid dissolved in oil; packaged in 4ml ampules containing 1,000 mg of steroid in total.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark993">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark994">Testosterone  undecanoate  is  a  modified  form  of testosterone, where a carboxylic acid ester (undecanoic acid) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Nebido® is designed to maintain physiological levels oftestosterone for up to 14 weeks after injection.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training, its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark995">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandroione  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark996">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark997">toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per  week  for  twenty  weeks  without  an  aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">4 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  8/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark998">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months after the drug has  fully  cleared  the  body.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">supraphysiological (rather than physiological) hormone levels would require injecting the drug on a more regular basis.The most logical protocol would be to administer a 4ml  injection  of  Nebido  every  2-4  weeks,  for  an approximate average weekly dosage of 250-500 mg of testosterone ester. At this level one could expect results very much in line with other testosterone esters, albeit with a less frequent injection schedule.The onset of action may, however, be much slower with Nebido. Some may opt to begin their cycle with a faster acting ester, such as enanthate or cypionate, which would allow testosterone levels to reach into supraphysiological ranges sooner. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids depending on the desired effect.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1001">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1002">Testosterone undecanoate is not approved for use with women  in  clinical  medicine.

It is similar in structure to stanozolol, which carries a 2,3-pyrazole group instead of the 2,3- isoxazole modification used here. Danazol is another commercial 2,3-isoxazole, although this particular agent has  minimal  anabolic  activity.  Similar  to  stanozolol, androisoxazol is non-estrogenic, and displays a highly favorable  balance  of  anabolic  to  androgenic  effect. Depending on the source, it is identified as having an anabolic to androgenic ratio ranging from 7:1, all the way up to 40:1. Although no longer available, this agent possesses  strong  muscle  building  and  performance enhancing properties, which are accompanied by a low inclination for androgenic side effects. Being a non- estrogenic agent, androisoxazol is well suited for lean mass gains, cutting purposes, and competitive athletics.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1005">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Androisoxazol was first described in 1961J The drug was developed into a medicine by Serono, an international pharmaceuticals giant that was originally founded in Italy in 1906 as Ares-Serono. Serono would sell the agent on the Italian drug market under the Neo-Ponden brand name. Androisoxazol  was  developed  subsequent  to  the successful synthesis of stanozolol a couple of years earlier, which is another heterocyclic steroid with a favorable anabolic/androgenic  profile.  Numerous  other  A-ring heterocyclic DHT derivatives were synthesized around the same  time  as  well,  including  thiazoles,  pyridines, oxadiazoles,  indoles,  and  triazoles.  The  isoxazole androisoxazol was found to be the most potent of this group, and most closely resembled stanozolol in its pharmacological properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Given its favorably low androgenic profile, androisoxazol was used clinically in a number of androgen sensitive patient populations including women, children, and the elderly.<span class="s33">2 3 </span>Although human studies on the drug are not</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">extensive, it appears to have been used with success and safety in these populations. In spite of this fact, however, it was ultimately short lived as a commercial product.Serono would discontinue sale of the agent less than a decade after introducing it in Italy, long before there was great controversy surrounding the use of anabolic steroids in sports. Androisoxazol was rarely studied outside of this region, although isolated other products containing the drug (such as the brand Androxan) did exist for a short time. Today, all forms of this agent have been out of commerce  for  so  long  that  few  people  have  any knowledge of it.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1006">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1007">Androisoxazol is no longer available as a prescription agent.

Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture,facial hair growth,and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, the 5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize androisoxazol, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.This is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity in relation to its tissue-building actions, making the  threshold  for  strong  androgenic  side  effects comparably higher than more androgenic agents such as testosterone, methandrostenolone, or fluoxymesterone.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Androisoxazol is a cl7-alpha alkylated compound.

Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1011">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Androisoxazol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol  due  to  its  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown,  non-aromatizable  nature,  and  route  of administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1013">section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (General):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Prescribing guidelines generally advise that oral steroids can be taken with or without meals.

This steroid is mostly commonly identified as part of the four-ester blend in Sustanon® 250, but here is described as a standalone agent.The long decanoate ester used to make testosterone decanoate creates a drug with pharmacokinetic properties similar to nandroione decanoate, providing a sustained release  of  hormone  (in  this  case  testosterone)  for approximately   three   weeks   following   injection. Testosterone decanoate is slightly slower-acting than the commercially available esters cypionate and enanthate, and  could  provide  a  slightly  less  frequent  injection schedule in comparison.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone decanoate was developed decades ago, and offers favorable pharmacokinetics of testosterone release (arguably more balanced than Sustanon® 250). In spite of this, testosterone decanoate was never a commercial success as a single-agent steroid product.The only modern preparation to contain this testosterone ester exclusively has been Neotest 250, a veterinary steroid produced by Loeffler in Mexico. This drug was favored by a small audience of loyal consumers because it offered less frequent injections than testosterone enanthate, and more user comfort than Sustanon® 250 (notorious for pain and soreness at the injection site). Neotest was only sold on the Mexican veterinary market for a short while, however. Political  pressures  against  steroid  sales  and  a  U.S. indictment of the company (Operation Gear Grinder) have apparently resulted in Loeffler eliminating Neotest from their product line, as well as many other &quot;controversial&quot; products. No other commercial product using testosterone decanoate as the only active agent is known to exist at this time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1032">How Supplied:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1033">Testosterone decanoate is no longer available as a standalone commercial drug product.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1035">concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1036">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.’</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1037">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per  week  for  twenty  weeks  without  an  aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">3 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1038">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The activity of this steroid is that of a mild to moderate oral anabolic steroid,  which  is  accompanied  by  distinguishable androgenic and estrogenic components. Although this steroid is essentially nandrolone modified (alkylated) to make oral dosing viable, it cannot be looked at simply as an oral alternative to Deca-Durabolin®. Most notably, the greatly increased estrogenicity caused by 17-alkylation makes norethandrolone much more problematic when trying to build quality (lean) muscle mass. In administering an effective amount of steroid in terms of muscle growth, the user has to deal with much more in terms of estrogenic side   effects.   The   muscle   accumulation   with norethandrolone is also going to be accompanied by a high level of water and (likely) fat retention, not the quality muscularity  normally  associated  with  nandrolone decanoate.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norethandrolone was first described in 1954.<span class="s33">1  </span>It was developed into a medicine by Searle, which introduced it into the U.S. prescription drug market under the Nilevar brand name during the late 1950&#39;s.The drug was originally sold as an oral tablet, an oral solution (with dropper bottle), and an injectable solution (in 25 mg ampules). The latter form of norethandrolone has been out of commerce for so long that few remember it was once also given by injection. Nilevar was prescribed for a variety of illnesses that were benefited by a protein sparing anabolic agent, Listed indications included preparation for and recovery from surgery, severe or prolonged illness, anorexia nervosa, severe burns and trauma, decubitus ulcers, osteoporosis, bone fracture healing, gastrointestinal disease, prolonged corticosteroid  administration,  and  various  forms  of malnourishment in adults and children.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Norethandrolone ultimately saw only limited success as a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">prescription anabolic agent. It did make its way to Europe and certain other markets, but not widely.The drug was an early functional anabolic, displaying more tissue-building properties than androgenic effects. But it also remained an agent with a troubling estrogenic side. This eventually led to norethandrolone being passed over clinically for more refined compounds as they became available. Searle decided to discontinue the sale of Nilevar in the U.S.during the 1960&#39;s, and instead began focusing energies on its newer, more strongly anabolic, and non-estrogenic steroid oxandrolone (sold as Anavar). Most other markets carrying norethandrolone, either by Searle or other companies, soon began losing this compound as well.Today, this drug is available on a limited basis, most notably in Australia where it remains viable on the veterinary drug market.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1044">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1045">Norethandrolone is available in select veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but typically contain 5 or 10 mg of steroid per tablet.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Norethandrolone is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by the addition of an ethyl group at carbon <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>7-alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1046">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norethandrolone is aromatized by the body, and converts to a synthetic estrogen with a high level of biological activity (17alpha-ethyl-estradiol). As a result, it is a highly estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia is often a concern during treatment, and may present itself quite early into a cycle (particularly when higher doses are used). At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build. Sensitive individuals may want to keep the estrogen under control with the addition</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">of  an  anti-estrogen  such  as  Nolvadex®.  One  may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective remedy for estrogen control. Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is of note that norethandrolone has some additional activity as a progestin in the body.<span class="s33">2 </span>The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins  without  excessive  estrogen  levels  being present. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by norethandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1047">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss.  Individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of this steroid may find a milder anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin®  to  be  more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include <i><b>a </b></i>deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of norethandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronorethandrolone. The 5-alpha reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism.The concurrent use <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>a 5-alpha  reductase  inhibitor  such  as  finasteride  or dutasteride will interfere with site-specific reduction of norethandrolone  action,  considerably  increasing  the tendency of the drug to produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with this steroid <span style=" color: #393939;">if </span>maintaining low relative androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Norethandrolone is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound.This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. Cl 7-alpha alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature in which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1048">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Norethandrolone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to  liver  breakdown  and  route  of  administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1049">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production.

When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, the drug is also used intermittently, with cycles usually lasting between 6 and 8 weeks in length followed by 6-8 weeks off. A daily dosage of 20 to 40 mg is most common for such applications. This level is typically sufficient for rapid gains in strength and muscle mass (bulk). The high estrogenicity makes norethandrolone of little value in speed and  endurance sports,  causing an unwanted retention of water weight. When given by injection, the same milligram dosage is recommended as when the drug is given orally.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The original prescribing guidelines for Nilevar made no special dosing recommendations for women, although it did warn that androgenicity is likely on a high dosage. When used by women for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes, a daily dosage of 5-10 mg is most common, taken for no longer than 4 weeks.

Being  a  four-component  testosterone  blend,  this preparation was most commonly compared to Sustanon®</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1056">250.  While  it  did  contain  testosterone  propionate, phenylpropionate, and isocaproate in the same strengths as Sustanon®, the last ester is different. It was a slightly shorter-acting drug, making Omnadren® more analogous to Testoviron® (the caproate ester is one carbon shorter than enanthate) than Sustanon® 250. Please note that there were even older versions of Omnadren® listing isohexanoate and hexanoate as the final two ingredients, which are simply different words for isocaproate and caproate.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Omnadren® 250 was developed in Poland by Polfa during the years of Soviet control. Its formulation (original) is very similar to that of Sustanon® 250, barring the substitution of one of the component esters.This was likely done to avoid patent issues with the international pharmaceutical giant Organon, which exclusively controlled the global supply of Sustanon® 250. In clinical medicine, Omnadren® 250 was used most commonly to treat adult men suffering from low  androgen  levels,  usually  noticing  symptoms  of impotence or hormonal disturbance of spermatogenesis. This drug was also used on occasion to treat adolescents with delayed puberty, and women with advanced breast or endometrial cancer.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The manufacture of Omnadren® 250 under the Polfa label was discontinued in 1994. That year, the newly privatized Polfa firm was renamed Jelfa, mainly to distinguish itself from other firms that use a Polfa prefix as part of their names. Jelfa continued to produce Omnadren® 250 for the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_327.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1057">domestic  market,  which  remained  available  without interruption in the same familiar 5-pack of ampules (albeit with a new company label and logo) for years after.Today, Jelfa continues to market Omnadren® 250 in Poland, as well as in many neighboring markets including Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kurdistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Moldavia, Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and  Belarus,  however  the  formulation  has  recently changed.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Omnadren 250 is designed to provide a rapid peak in testosterone levels (24-48 hours after injection), and maintain physiological concentrations for approximately 14 days.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1059">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">(estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1060">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandroione  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1061">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1062">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  In  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver. This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per  week,  the  impact  on lipid profile tends  to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1063">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

As is typical for many 19-nor steroids, this agent  exhibits  far  greater  anabolic  properties  than androgenic, is only weakly estrogenic, and is strongly progestational.  Structurally,  ethylestrenol  most  closely resembles Nilevar (norethandrolone). The two differ only by the absence of an oxygen atom at the c3 position of ethylestrenol, and in the body ethylestrenol actually has a notable affinity to convert to norethandrolone.<span class="s33">1 </span>This path of metabolism is responsible for much of the anabolic, androgenic, and estrogenic activity we see with this compound, and in most regards ethylestrenol can be viewed  as  a  pro-drug  to  norethandrolone.  Although ethylestrenol  is  strongly  anabolic  relative  to  its androgenicity, athletes generally find this steroid to be extremely weak.The level of muscle growth obtained with this steroid is generally much less noticeable than that expected with either Nilevar or Deca-Durabolin®, and it is considerably  less  effective  than  both  stanozolol  and oxandrolone on a milligram for milligram basis.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1070">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol  was  first  described  in  1959.<span class="s33">2  </span>It  was developed  into  an  oral  medicine  by  Organon  (now Merck/MSD), appearing in most markets between 1961 and 1964. Organon sold the tablets under the trade name Maxibolin in the U.S., and as Orabolin, Orgabolin, and Durabolin-0 in other markets. The latter name is a compressed form of &quot;Durabolin-Oral,&quot; noting that the drug is  an  oral  cousin  to  Durabolin  (nandrolone phenylpropionate).  Organon  also  produced  oral ethylestrenol solutions, such as Maxibolin Elixir (U.S.) and Fertabolin (India, Philippines). Ethylestrenol was initially indicated for several uses, mainly focused on preserving lean mass. Early U.S. product literature states,&quot;.<span class="s13">  </span>along</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">with <i><b>a good </b></i>dietary regimen, Maxibolin promotes tissue­ building and weight gain, stimulation of appetite and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="159" alt="image" src="img/Image_332.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">sense of wellbeing, renewal of vigor, is an aid in bone matrix reconstruction and in combating the depression and  weakness  of  chronic  illness  or  prolonged convalescence.

Advertising on Fertabolin in India claimed the drug would &quot;help children gain full weight and height,&quot; &quot;simulates physiological appetite,&quot; and &quot;ensures optimal assimilation of food.&quot; It also described a &quot;delicious [raspberry) syrup flavor children love.&quot; The main point of contention was the promotion of an anabolic steroid to treat the lack of adequate food supply, the real issue at hand.  Many  viewed  Organon&#39;s  actions  as  potentially dangerous and highly unethical, and the company soon discontinued Fertabolin and related marketing practices. Maxibolin and Maxibolin Elixir were voluntarily withdrawn from the U.S. market during the late 1980&#39;s as well, and most Western ethylestrenol products from Organon soon followed. Today, Merck/MSD retains only a limited interest in the drug. Ethylestrenol is currently a rare find, as it is only manufactured (as a generic drug or under other brand names) is a select few countries.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol is available in select human and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but typically contains 2mg of steroid per tablet. Oral solutions have also been produced in the past, such as Maxibolin Elixir, which contained 2mg/5 mL in a 4 ounce bottle. Fertabolin for children contained</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">.2mg/2 mL of solution.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1072">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">1 ) the addition of an ethyl group at carbon 17-alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration and 2) the removal of the 3-oxygen.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1073">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol is aromatized by the body, and converts to a synthetic estrogen with a high level of biological activity (17alpha-ethyl-estradiol). Rate of aromatization is so low, however, that it remains classified as a weakly estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia is possible during treatment, but generally only when higher doses are used. Water and fat retention can also become issues, again depending on dose. Sensitive individuals may need to addition an anti- estrogen such as Nolvadex®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective remedy for estrogen control. Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1074"><span style=" color: #393939;">It </span></a>is of note that ethylestrenol has strong activity as a progestin in the body.<span class="s33">3 </span>The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins aiso augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins without excessive estrogen levels being present.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by this steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss.  Individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of this steroid may find a milder anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin®  to  be  more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of ethylestrenol  is reduced by its  reduction to weaker &quot;dihidyo&quot; metabolites. The 5-alpha reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism.The concurrent use of a 5- alpha  reductase  inhibitor  such  as  finasteride  or</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">dutasteride will interfere with site-specific reduction of ethylestrenol action, increasing the tendency of the drug to produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with this steroid if maintaining low relative androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1075">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ethylestrenol is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  Cl  7-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature in which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1076">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Ethylestrenol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol  due  to  its  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

This oral steroid is structurally a cross between methandrostenolone     and     clostebol     (4- chlorotestosterone), having the same base structure as Dianabol with the added 4-chloro alteration of clostebol. This alteration makes chlorodehydromethyltestosterone a milder cousin of Dianabol, the new steroid displaying no estrogenic  and  a  much  less  androgenic  activity  in comparison to its more famous counterpart. The anabolic activity of chlorodehydromethyltestosterone is somewhat lower than that of Dianabol as well, but it does maintain a much more favorable balance of anabolic to androgenic effect. This means that at any given level of muscle­ building activity, chlorodehydromethyltestosterone will be less likely to produce androgenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1083">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone was first described in <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>962.<span class="s33">1 </span>Jenapharm (Jena, Germany) soon after released the drug for sale in the East German prescription drug market, under the brand name Oral Turinabol. The drug was favored by clinicians for its highly anabolic and low anabolic nature, lending itself to use in not only adult males, but women and children as well. The product was manufactured in two strengths, containing Img and 5 mg of drug per tablet, so that a lower-dosed version was available   for  the  more  sensitive  populations. Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone  was  applied  for  a number of medical uses: mainly those focusing on the building or preservation of lean muscle tissue and bone mass.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oral Turinabol became a steroid of infamy during the 1990&#39;s,    when   it   was   revealed   that chlorodehydromethyltestosterone had been one of the closely held secrets inside the &quot;East German Doping Machine.&quot; This is referring to the state-sponsored doping program, called &quot;State Plan Research Theme 14.25,&quot; that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">operated in East Germany between 1974 and 1989. It was an aggressive anabolic steroid administration program, designed with one goal in mind: cheating the Olympic drug test. In many cases, the Olympic athletes, both male and female, were unwitting participants, simply told by their trainers and coaches that they were being given &quot;vitamins.&quot; Many of these blue vitamins turned out to be Oral Turinabol, a potent and undetectable (at the time) anabolic steroid. As many as 10,000 athletes were given anabolic steroids during the time the program was active, many of them taking Oral Turinabol. For a more in-depth look at this dramatic historic event, including the trials of several former East German officials for their participation, I recommend you look at the book&quot;Faust<span class="s33">l</span>s Gold: Inside the East German Doping Machine&quot; by Steven Ungerleider.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1084">In spite of an arguably favorable profile of activity and safety record, Jenapharm discontinued Oral Turinabol in 1994. This was at a time when a great deal of negative attention  was  being  given  to  sports  doping,  lending credibility to the speculation that this decision was one based on public relations, and not necessarily finances or health concerns over the drug. Regardless, Jenapharm was acquired by Schering AG (Germany) in 1996, a company with no interest in reliving the controversies of the past (Schering  had  already  discontinued  many  of  its controversial anabolic steroid products as well). Before or since, no other brand of chlorodehydromethyltestosterone has existed as a prescription drug product. Today, this agent is still available, but is only produced by a small number of underground manufacturers and export-only suppliers.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone is not available as a prescription drug product. When manufactured, it was found in Img and 5 mg tablets,sold in Germany/German Democratic Republic.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1085">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1086">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group  at  carbon  17-alpha,  which  helps  protect  the hormone during oral administration, 2) the introduction of a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 (1-ene), which shifts the anabolic to androgenic ratio in favor of the former, and 3) the attachment of a chloro group at carbon 4,  which  inhibits  steroid  aromatization  and  reduces relative androgenicity.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1087">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone  can  be  positively identified using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests B &amp; C. The drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) color change to maroon in Substance Test C. With Substance Test B, it should produce an immediate orange color reaction.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1088">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti- estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although  chlorodehydromethyltestosterone  is  classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Doses higher than normally prescribed are more likely to cause such side  effects.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.  Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone  is  not extensively  metabolized  by  the  5-alpha  reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1089">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone  is  a  cl  7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage  of  the  drug  entry  into  the  bloodstream</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha  alkylated anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be  hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver damage. In rare instances life-threatening dysfunction may develop.lt is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1090">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its non- aromatizable  nature,  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown,   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1091">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

This level is sufficient for measurable increases in lean muscle mass and strength. This agent is most often applied as a pre­ contest or cutting steroid for bodybuilding purposes, and is not viewed as an ideal bulking agent due to its lack of estrogenicity.

In structure, it is most closely related to 4-hydroxytestosterone, differing only by the addition of a c-17 alpha methyl group, which makes oral dosing viable. Like its non-methylated analog, oxymesterone remains an effective lean-tissue-building steroid with only a minimal to moderate androgenic component. It has no known estrogenic or progestational activity, and no discernable ability  to  cause  side  effects  related  to  female  sex hormones. Oxymesterone is a &quot;clean&quot; drug among oral steroids: potent, non-aromatizable, and primarily anabolic in nature. According to the standard laboratory assays, oxymesterone is over three times more anabolic than methyltestosterone,  with  only  half  the  androgenicity. Closer comparisons to methyltestosterone, which may seem structurally logical, do not hold up well in practice, given the sharp contrasts in relative effects between these drugs. The differences are as drastic as their applications, with methyltestosterone being used almost exclusively for bulking phases of training while oxymesterone would fit most  comfortably  with  cutting  cycles  or  competitive athletics.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxymesterone was first closely described in 1956.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine during the early 1960&#39;s by Societa  Farmaceutici  (Italy),  which  filed  for  patent protection on this compound in at least three countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy.<span class="s33">2 </span>This drug saw limited clinical use as a prescription agent under the Oranabol brand name in Spain and Italy, and under the names Anamidol, Balnimax, Sanabol, and Theranabol in other countries including Japan, the UK, and the Netherlands.

At very</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">best,  only  a  small  handful  of  U.S.  athletes  have experimented with this obscure anabolic steroid over the years, and certainly very few in recent times.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1100">By the 1990&#39;s, oxymesterone had already become a forgotten relic of early steroid development. In all this time there has been limited mention of its use in the medical literature. The drug did show up in a report released in 1993 by the department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology at St. Vincent’s Hospital in New South Wales, concerning two young football players who died of cardiac events in 1988 and 1990. The two men, who had unobstructed arteries and were only 18 and 24 years of age,</a><span class="s33">3 </span>died during routine training sessions. Despite never being offered for sale in Australia, and having been removed  from  the  global  market  long  before  1988, oxymesterone had been detected in the men during autopsy. No conclusive link between the drug and their deaths could be established, neither discounted. Today, oxymesterone remains unavailable as a prescription agent worldwide.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Oxymesterone is no longer available as a prescription drug product.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1101">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Oxymesterone is a modified form of testosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha, which  helps  protect  the  hormone  during  oral administration, and 2) the attachment of a hydroxyl group at carbon 4, which inhibits steroid aromatization and reduces relative androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1102">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Oxymesterone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note  that  when  a  4-hydroxyl  group  is  applied  to testosterone  (as  in  hydroxytestosterone)  a  suicide aromatase inhibitor is created, capable of significantly suppressing serum estrogen levels. It is unknown if this property exists in Oranabol (methylhydroxytestosterone), as this potential aspect of its pharmacology has never been  investigated.  Its  non-estrogenic  and  non- progestational profile would support, at the very least, this agent being a steroid for increasing muscle density and visibility,  regardless  of  a  related  aromatase-inhibiting effect, which may indeed also be present.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1103">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although  oxymesterone  is  classified  as  an  anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair growth.  Doses higher than normally prescribed are more likely to cause such side effects. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture,facial hair growth,and clitoral enlargement. Note that oxymesterone is not extensively metabolized by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1104">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxymesterone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration,  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction  may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of c17-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Note that in studies this agent offered   slightly   less   hepatic   strain   than methandrostenolone and norethandrolone, as measured by bromosulphalein (BSP) retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1105">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Oxymesterone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol  due  to  its  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1106">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1107">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">4 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1108">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A common clinical dose for oxymesterone was 20-40 mg per day. In the athletic arena, an effective oral daily dosage also falls in the range of 20-40 mg, taken in cycles lasting no more than 6-8 weeks to minimize hepatotoxicity. This level is sufficient for formidable strength gains, increased fat loss, increased muscle definition, and an overall increase in lean muscle mass. This drug would further stack well with a variety of other steroids, especially a 200-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">400 mg per week dose of an injectable base like testosterone cypionate/enanthate or Equipoise® during bulking phases of training, or a milder anabolic like Deca- Durabolin® or Primobolan® for cutting and defining. All of these stack combinations should work extremely well, and would not add to the liver toxicity already present in oxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1109">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">A common clinical dose for oxymesterone was 20-40 mg per day.

Testosterone propionate is, therefore, comparatively much faster-acting than other testosterone esters such as cypionate or enanthate, and requires a much more frequent dosing schedule. By most accounts testosterone propionate is an older and cruder form of injectable testosterone, made obsolete by the slower-acting and more comfortable esters that were developed subsequent to it. Still, those who are not bothered  by  the  frequent  injection  schedule  find testosterone propionate every bit as acceptable. As an injectable testosterone, it is a powerful mass-building drug, capable of producing rapid gains in both muscle size and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1112">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  propionate  was  first  described  in  1935, during a series of experiments that set out to increase the therapeutic  usefulness  of  testosterone  by  slowing  its release into the bloodstream.<span class="s33">1 </span>Two years later, Schering AG in  Germany  would  introduce  the  first  testosterone propionate product under the brand name Testoviron®. Propionate  was  also  the  first  commercially  available injectable ester of testosterone on the U.S. prescription drug  market,  and  remained  the  dominant  form  of testosterone globally before 1960. Back during the early 1950&#39;s, for example, when steroids were first being experimented with by small numbers of American athletes, the only readily available anabolic/androgenic steroids were  methyltestosterone,  testosterone  propionate,  and testosterone suspension. Interesting enough, during this time testosterone propionate was also available in orally administered (Buccal) preparations, but they disappeared from the U.S. market during the 1980&#39;s.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_344.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Early prescribing guidelines for testosterone propionate called for a number of therapeutic uses. It was mainly applied to cases of male androgen insufficiency, and those issues normally surrounding low testosterone levels such as reduced sex drive and impotence in adults, and cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) in teenagers and young adults. But it also had such other uses as treating menopause,  menorrhagia  (heavy  menstrual  bleeding), menstrual  tension,  chronic  cystic  mastitis  (fibrocystic breasts), endometriosis, and excessive lactation, covering a wide range of situations in which the male hormone testosterone was being applied to female patients. Over the years these wide guidelines were narrowed by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration, however, and by the 1980&#39;s, testosterone propionate was being largely applied only to male patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone propionate has a long history of availability in the U.S. and abroad, and remains a very common form of testosterone on the global market to this day. It must be emphasized, however, that its ability to remain on the market  is  more  a  product  of  history  than  unique application.  Testosterone  propionate  was  the  first acceptable ester of testosterone, and consequently has many decades of history as a useable therapeutic agent. Many companies have sold it for decades now,and so long as it is still in demand will continue to do so. But other (more modern) forms of testosterone such as enanthate and cypionate are much more popular today, as they are much  slower-acting  still,  and  allow  for  far  more comfortable  administration  schedules.  Testosterone propionate is still approved for sale in the United States, although  its  ultimate  market  future  here  remains questionable.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Bodybuilders commonly consider propionate to be the mildest testosterone ester, and the preferred form of this hormone for dieting/cutting phases of training.

Realistically, however, these advantages do not hold up to close scrutiny. The propionate  ester  is  actually  removed  before  the testosterone it carries is active in the body, and ultimately has little effect outside of slowing steroid release. It all really boils down to how much testosterone you are getting into your blood with each particular esterified compound.  Otherwise,  there  are  no  real  functional differences between them.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone propionate is widely available in human and veterinary drug markets.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1117">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels) of testosterone propionate more likely to require the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor.  Since  water  retention  and  loss  of  muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that both anabolic and androgenic effects are mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1118">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1119">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">4 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per  week, the  impact  on lipid profile tends  to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1120">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Many sensitive individuals choose to stay away from this steroid completely, their bodies reacting with a pronounced soreness and low-grade fever that may last for a few days after each injection. Even the mild soreness that is experienced by most users can be quite  uncomfortable,  especially  when  you  take  into account that the drug is being administered multiple times each week for a number of consecutive weeks.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To  treat  androgen  insufficiency,  early  prescribing guidelines recommended a dosage of 25 mg given two to three times per week. Modern product literature usually recommends 25 mg to 50 mg given two to three times per week for the same purpose. The usual dosage among male athletes is in the range of 50-100 mg per injection, which is given every second or third day. Similar to other esters  of  testosterone,  testosterone  propionate  is commonly used at a weekly cumulative dosage between 200 mg to 400 mg.This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1123">Testosterone  propionate  is  usually  incorporated  into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than definition. Some do incorporate this drug into cutting cycles as well, but typically in lower doses (100-200 mg per week) and/or when accompanied by an aromatase inhibitor to keep estrogen levels under control.  Testosterone  propionate  is  a  very  effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. Some, however, find a need to stack it with other anabolic/androgenic steroids for a stronger effect, in which case an additional 200-400 mg per week of boldenone  undecylenate,  methenolone  enanthate,  or nandrolone decanoate should provide substantial results with  no  significant  hepatotoxicity.  Testosterone  is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone propionate is rarely used with women in clinical medicine. When applied, it is most often used as a secondary medication during inoperable breast cancer, when other therapies have failed to produce a desirable effect and suppression of ovarian function is necessary. Testosterone propionate is not recommended for women for performance-enhancing purposes due to its strong androgenic nature and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.  Female  bodybuilders  who  insist  on  using testosterone, however, often choose propionate, as blood levels are easier to control with this ester compared to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">cypionate  or  enanthate.

Also called methylnandrolone or methylnortestosterone, normethandrolone can crudely be looked at as the &quot;methyltestosterone of nandrolone.&quot; It differs from its parent hormone nandrolone only by the addition of c-17 alpha methyl group, the same alteration that creates methyltestosterone from testosterone.This, of course, was added to make oral dosing viable. Animal studies looking at the oral potency of this steroid rate it to be  roughly  3-6  times  more  anabolic  than methyltestosterone, while possessing only roughly </a><span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>0-25% more androgenicity.<span class="s33">1 </span><span class="s50">2  </span>The overall anabolic-androgenic ratio of this steroid falls somewhere between 3:1 and 5.5:1. Although it is effective orally, normethandrolone is not the most ideal steroid for bodybuilders and athletes, at least where lean mass or sports performance are concerned (something for which nandrolone is highly favored). In this case  methylation  has  amplified  the  estrogenic  and progestational activity of the steroid considerably, which means that muscle gains are likely to be accompanied by considerable water and fat retention.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">Normethandrolone was first described in 1954.<span class="s50">3 </span>Shortly after, it was developed into a medicine by Organon (now Merck/MSD), which introduced it under the Orgasterone brand name in Belgium and Switzerland, and as Orga­ steron in the Netherlands. This steroid had also been sold by other manufacturers in various parts of Europe as Methalutin, Lutenin, and Matdonal. Although a simple oral methylated  nandrolone,  with  strong  properties  as  an anabolic steroid, normethandrolone exhibits such strong progestational activity that it was marketed as an oral progestin. Its anabolic effects were more looked at as secondary applications for the drug, and accounted for very little medical interest. It was also mainly sold under the trivial name methylestrenolone, which again seems to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">visibly separate the drug from the anabolic steroid category.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1127">Given the unobvious naming and unrelated marketing of normethandrolone,  it  was  ultimately  given  very  little interest by athletes. Even during the 1960&#39;s, a time when many new and exotic agents were appearing on the black market, normethandrolone was essentially unheard of.The various  normethandrolone  preparations  soon  began drying up, as newer and more targeted oral progestins became  available  to  clinicians.  The  drug  quietly disappeared from the various international markets before bodybuilders  ever  made  any  type  of  substantial connection  with  it.  Normethandrolone  is  now discontinued worldwide. Note that in spite of its current obscurity in the U.S., normethandrolone was added to the Federal controlled substances laws in 2004 as a schedule III anabolic steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Normethandrolone is no longer available as a prescription drug product.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1128">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Normethandrolone is a modified form of nandrolone.

As a result, it is a highly estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia is often a concern during treatment, and may present itself quite early into a cycle (particularly when higher doses are used). At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous  water  retention  and  fat  levels  build. Sensitive individuals may want to keep the estrogen under</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">control with the addition of an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which is a more effective  remedy  for  estrogen  control.  Aromatase inhibitors, however, can be quite expensive in comparison to standard estrogen maintenance therapies, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is also of note that normethandrolone has very strong activity as a progestin in the body.<span class="s33">4 </span>In fact, it was assayed to be more active than progesterone itself.<span class="s33">5  </span>Studies usually  refer  to  this  agent  as  a  progestogenic (progestational)  compound  with  anabolic  action,  not directly as an anabolic/androgenic steroid.The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen,  including  negative  feedback  inhibition  of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins  also  augment  the  stimulatory  effect  of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins  without  excessive  estrogen  levels  being present. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, may be sufficient to mitigate gynecomastia caused by normethandrolone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1130">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male  pattern  hair  loss,  individuals  sensitive  to  the androgenic effects of this steroid may find a milder anabolic  such  as  Deca-Durabolin®  to  be  more comfortable.  Women  are  additionally  warned  of  the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that in androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the relative androgenicity of normethandrolone  is  reduced  by  its  reduction  to dihydronormethandrolone.  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme is responsible for this metabolism.The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with site-specific reduction of normethandrolone  action,  considerably  increasing  the tendency of the drug to produce androgenic side effects. Reductase inhibitors should be avoided with this steroid if maintaining low relative androgenicity is desired.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Normethandrolone is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. 07- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction  may  develop.  It is advisable  to visit  a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid  escalating  liver  strain.  Jaundice  (bile  duct obstruction) was reported as early as 1958 with this steroid,<span class="s33">6  </span>so  this  possibility  definitely  should  not  be disregarded. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic  nature  in  which  most  people  use  oral anabolic/androgenic  steroids,  although  cannot  be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1131">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Normethandrolone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to  liver  breakdown  and  route  of  administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1132">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Trenbolone  appears  most  commonly  as  trenbolone acetate, which is a much faster-acting form of the drug (see: Finajet). The hexahydrobenzylcarbonate ester used here extends the release of trenbolone for more than 2 weeks, which has always been thought of as more suitable for human use due to the less frequent injection schedule. The base steroid trenbolone is roughly three times more androgenic than testosterone, making it a fairly potent androgen. It also displays about 3 times greater tissue­ building  activity  in  comparison  to  its  androgenic properties, making its official classification as that of an anabolic steroid.The muscle-building effect of trenbolone is often compared to such popular bulking agents as testosterone or Dianabol, but without the same estrogen- related side effects. It is most commonly identified as a lean-mass-building drug, and is extremely popular with athletes for its ability to promote the rapid buildup of strength, muscle size, and definition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1140">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first long-acting trenbolone ester (undecanoate) was studied in 1967, described during a series of experiments into  synthetic  anabolic  steroids  by  Roussel-UCLAF.<span class="s33">1 </span>Trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate was a subsequent and uniquely French slant to this long-acting anabolic steroid, possessing an unusual but roughly equivalent compound.  Trenbolone  hexahydrobenzylcarbonate  was developed into a medicine by Negma Laboratoires in France, which sold the drug under the Parabolan trade name. It was also sold for a period of time as Hexabolan, a name that referred to the unusual ester it possesses. Trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate is the only known form of trenbolone ever produced as a medicine for human consumption. The most notable appearance of trenbolone comes as trenbolone acetate, which is used</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_352.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">widely and exclusively in veterinary medicine.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Parabolan was prescribed in France as a protein-sparing anabolic agent in cases of cachexia (lean body mass wasting) and malnutrition, as well as to combat certain forms of osteoporosis. Its prescribing guidelines included recommendations for the treatment of androgen-sensitive populations, such as women and the elderly. Owing to its moderate androgenic properties, however, the drug was contraindicated  in  children,  especially  young  females. Parabolan remained on the French market for a very long time, although it was finally discontinued (voluntarily) by Negma in 1997. For a brief period of time it seemed that the demise of Parabolan would mark the end of human­ use  trenbolone  preparations,  as  no  other  medicine approved for human use was known to exist worldwide at the time. A very small number of Parabolan preparations have been brought to market since, however, so while the drug is still poorly available, it is not completely defunct.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1141">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone  hexahydrobenzylcarbonate  is  no  longer produced  as  a  prescription  drug  product.  When manufactured in France it came in the form of a 1.5 mL ampule containing 76mg of steroid (product information lists this as equivalent to 50 mg of base trenbolone).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1142">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Trenbolone is a modified form of nandrolone. It differs by the introduction of double bonds at carbons 9 and 11, which inhibit aromatization (9-ene), increase androgen­ binding affinity,<span class="s33">2 </span>and slows its metabolism. The resulting steroid is significantly more potent as both an anabolic and an androgen than its nandrolone base. The trenbolone here is modified with a hexahydrobenzylcarbonate ester at the 17-beta hydroxyl group, so that the free steroid is released more slowly from the area of injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1143">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1144">Trenbolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. It is of note, however, that this steroid  displays  significant  binding  affinity  for  the progesterone   receptor   (slightly   stronger   than progesterone itself).</a><span class="s33">3 4 </span>The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to those of estrogen, including negative feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the  estrogenic  component  of  this  disorder,  is  often sufficient  to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by progestational  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  Note  that progestational  side  effects  are  more  common  when trenbolone  is  being  taken  with  other  aromatizable steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, trenbolone is sufficiently androgenic. Androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, and may include bouts of oily  skin,  acne,  and  body/facial  hair  growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and  clitoral  enlargement.  Additionally,  the  5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize trenbolone<span class="s33">5</span>, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and is generally not considered a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity is unlikely.This steroid does have a strong level of resistance to hepatic breakdown, however, and severe liver toxicity has been noted in bodybuilders abusing trenbolone.<span class="s33">6 </span>Although unlikely, hepatotoxicity cannot be completely excluded, especially with high doses.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1145">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.

Due to its non- aromatizable nature and strong resistance to metabolism, trenbolone has a moderate to strong (negative) impact on lipid values and atherogenic risk. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1146">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.  In  experimental  studies,  trenbolone  was determined to be approximately three times stronger at suppressing  gonadotropins  than  testosterone  on  a milligram for milligram basis.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1147">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Therapy was initiated the first month with all 3 ampules given over the first 15 days. During the subsequent 3 months, one injection (76 mg) was given every 10 days. For  physique-  or  performance-enhancing  purposes, trenbolone  hexahydrobenzylcarbonate  is  most  often administered at a dosage of 152-220 mg per week. The drug would be taken in cycles ranging from 6 to 12 weeks. Although a weekly administration schedule would be more than sufficient, athletes usually injected a single ampule (76mg) at a time, and the total amount would be spread  evenly  throughout  the  week.  Although  not necessary, this type of schedule helps to reduce injection volume per application.

Such combinations will elicit a greater level of density and hardness to the build, often proving dramatic for a stage appearance. We could also look  for  bulk  with  this  drug,  and  addition  stronger compounds like Dianabol or Testosterone. While the mass gain would be quite formidable with such a stack, some level of water retention would probably also accompany it. Moderately effective anabolics such Deca-Durabolin® or Equipoise® would be somewhat of a halfway point, providing extra strength and mass but without the same level of water bloat we see with more readily aromatized steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1149">Trenbolone  hexahydrobenzylcarbonate  was  generally administered in a clinical dosage of 3 ampules per month.

It is a short chain ester of testosterone, although was designed in this case to have a protracted effect in the body similar to testosterone cypionate or enanthate. As an injectable testosterone, testosterone phenylacetate is a powerful mass-building drug, capable of producing rapid gains in both muscle size and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1151">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone phenylacetate was developed by Ciba during the 1960&#39;s, the same company to introduce Dianabol (methandrostenolone) to the world. This steroid was sold in  the  U.S.  under  the  brand  name  of  Perandren® phenylacetate, which incidentally had used the same Perandren  name  that  Ciba  had  designated  for  its testosterone  propionate  years  earlier  (Perandren® propionate).  At  the  time  of  its  release,  Perandren phenylacetate was intended to offer improvements over other esters of testosterone, most notably a longer window of therapeutic effect following each injection. Product information on the drug from 1967 reads, &quot;[Perandren phenylacetate] Has a more prolonged action than other androgens and a markedly greater intensity of effect; in adequate dosage, a single injection per month suffices for many patients.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Early prescribing guidelines for testosterone phenylacetate called for a number of therapeutic uses. It was mainly applied to cases of male androgen insufficiency, and those issues normally surrounding low testosterone levels such as reduced sex drive and impotence in adults, and cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) in teenagers and young adults. But it also had such other uses as treating osteoporosis,  menorrhagia  (heavy  menstrual  bleeding), metrorrhagia  (abnormal  bleeding  of  the  uterus),  and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="323" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_358.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">breast cancer. It was also used to offset the catabolic effects of corticosteroids, to heal fractures, to promote wellness following surgery or convalescence, and as a general tissue-repairing anabolic when needed.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1152">The  life  of  Perandren  phenylacetate  on  the  U.S. prescription drug market was ultimately a short one. By the late 1960&#39;$, other &quot;new&quot; esters of testosterone were also widely  available,  namely  testosterone  cypionate  and enanthate, and Ciba&#39;s slow-acting creation was quickly losing market share to these agents. These esters of testosterone offered a similar period of therapeutic benefit to Perandren phenylacetate, but with considerably more patient comfort (they did not need to be mixed with anesthetic  for  injections  to  be  semi-tolerable  like Perandren phenylacetate). As a result of this shift in consumer  interest,  Ciba  withdrew  this  product  from market. By 1970, Perandren phenylacetate was no longer available.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1153">Testosterone phenylacetate is no longer commercially available. When produced, it contained 50 mg/ml of steroid in a water-based solution.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  phenylacetate  is  a  modified  form  of testosterone, where a carboxylic acid ester (acetic acid phenyl ester) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1154">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen). The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1155">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandroione  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1156">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1157">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of ail anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1158">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">they would slowly dissolve over time. Product information on Perandren phenylacetate stated that injections could result in local irritation, pain, and redness. To help offset the  discomfort  associated  with  injection,  each  vial contained 1% procaine by weight, which acted as a local anesthetic. Although this was an effective method of delivering testosterone over time, patient comfort was likely not ideal with this formulation.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1160">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To  treat  androgen  insufficiency,  early  prescribing guidelines recommended a dosage of 50 mg to 200 mg given every 3 to 5 weeks. An adequate dosage among male athletes would be in the range of 200 mg to 400 mg per week. Although active for longer periods of time, weekly injections would be preferred due to the low dosage and tendency for pain at the site of injection (large injection volumes would not be advisedj.The total weekly dosage may need to be further subdivided into two or more separate injections. A 200-400 mg per week dosage level  would  be  sufficient  for  most  users  to  notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1161">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Product  information  for  Perandren  phenylacetate recommended no more than 150 mg per month for women, so as to avoid virilizing side effects.

Methenolone  acetate  is  a  non-c!7-alpha- alkylated oral steroid, one of only a few commercially available oral agents that presents limited liver toxicity to the user. It is also highly favored for its properties as a moderately effective anabolic with low androgenic and no estrogenic properties. It is, likewise, commonly used during cutting phases of training, when lean tissue growth and solid muscularity, not raw bulk, are the key objectives.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1166">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Methenolone was first described in I960.<span class="s33">1 </span>Squibb would introduce the drug (as methenolone acetate) to the United States in 1962.<span class="s33">2 </span>This agent was sold for a very short time as a 20 mg tablet, under the brand name of Nibal®. Schering in West Germany (now Bayer) would be granted rights to the drug that same year, and would sell it under the Primobolan® name. Nibal® was soon removed from the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S. market, never to return as a commercial product. Schering now had exclusive patent rights to produce methenolone acetate, and would continue to sell the drug uninterrupted since 1962, and consumers had naturally come to identify methenolone acetate as a product of Schering.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Primobolan® has always been identified as a European steroid, and during the 1960&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s was being offered for sale in such countries as Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Finland. At one time Schering also manufactured a 20 mg/ml oil-based injectable of methenolone  acetate  in  limited  markets  (called Primobolan® Acetate), but it has been out of manufacture since 1993. Injectable methenolone acetate proved to be very popular for pre-contest cutting use, and was gravely missed among European competitors when discontinued.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although we still have the acetate in oral form, it is a close, but not equal,substitute (injection is a much more efficient form of delivery for this steroid).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Primobolan® is prescribed as a lean tissue building anabolic agent, often used in cases where body wasting has  occurred  secondary  to  major  surgery,  infection, wasting disease, aggressive corticosteroid administration, or malnutrition. (Some clinicians also prescribe this agent for treating osteoporosis and sarcopenia, or the natural loss of muscle mass with aging).This steroid has also been used to promote weight gain in underweight premature infants and children in clinical studies, and was able to do so effectively and without signs of toxicity or undesirable effects.<span class="s33">3 </span>Athletes have long favored the combined strong anabolic, weak androgenic, and non-estrogenic nature of this drug, which makes it very desirable for building lean muscularity without side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although Primobolan® demonstrated a good record of clinical safety, Schering had withdrawn this drug from most markets by the early 2000s. No 50 mg versions are still in manufacture, and at most a select couple of products containing 5 mg or 25 mg may still be in circulation. The only confirmed sources for oral brand name Primobolan in recent years were in Japan and South Africa, and these were sold under the Schering name. It is unknown if any such products have been brought over to the new Bayer label.  Aside  from  this,  a  very  small  number  of pharmaceutical  preparations  containing  methenolone acetate may still be in production.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1167">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All forms of Schering Primobolan® contain 5 mg, 25 mg, or</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">50 mg (no longer available) of methenolone acetate per tablet.

It contains one additional double bond between carbons 1 and 2, which helps to stabilize the 3-keto group and increase  the  steroid&#39;s  anabolic  properties,  and  an additional 1-methyl group, which protects the steroid against hepatic metabolism. Primobolan makes use of methenolone with a carboxylic acid ester (acetic acid) attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group to further help protect  it  from  oxidation  during  oral  administration. Studies  have  demonstrated  the  methenolone  is  an effective oral anabolic agent in both the acetate and unesterified forms.</a><span class="s33">4 </span><span class="s50">5</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1170">Methenolone Acetate can be positively identified using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp; B.

Estrogen-linked  side  effects should not be seen when administering this steroid. Sensitive individuals need not worry about developing gynecomastia,  nor  should  they  be  noticing  any appreciable water retention with this drug. The increase seen with methenolone should be quality muscle mass, not the smooth bulk that often accompanies steroids open to aromatization. During a cycle, the user should additionally  not  notice  strong  elevations  in  blood pressure, as this effect is also related (generally) to estrogen and water retention. Methenolone is a steroid most favored during cutting phases of training, when water and fat retention are major concerns, and sheer mass not the central objective.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1171">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Methenolone is still a very mild steroid, however, and strong androgenic side effects are typically related to higher doses. Women often find this preparation an acceptable choice, observing it to be a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">very comfortable and effective anabolic.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methenolone is not considered a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity  is  unlikely.  Studies  have  failed  to  produce appreciable changes in markers of hepatic stress when the drug was given in therapeutic levels.<span class="s33">7 </span>This steroid does  have  some  resistance  to  hepatic  breakdown, however, and liver toxicity,failure, and death was reported in  one  elderly  patient  receiving  oral  methenolone acetate.<span class="s33">8  </span>Although  unlikely,  hepatotoxicity  cannot  be completely excluded, especially with very high oral doses.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1172">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Methenolone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandrolone due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a much weaker impact than c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Due to the route of delivery, oral methenolone will have a slightly stronger negative effect on lipids compared to methenolone  enanthate  injections.  Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1173">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">intervention.  Primobolan®  is  generally  described  as having  a  low  impact  on  endogenous  testosterone production. While this may be true in small clinical doses (20-25 mg daily), this may not be a major distinction when used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes. In one study, more than half of the patients receiving only 30-45 mg per day noticed a 15-65% suppression of gonadotropin levels.<span class="s33">9 </span>While this is far from having no hormonal  impact,  the  suppression  caused  by methenolone acetate may still be less pronounced than with many other agents. If Primobolan® is used at moderate doses for less than 8 weeks, hormonal recovery should not be a protracted experience.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dianabol or Anadrol 50® is common, although the gains are often accompanied by some level of smoothness due to  the  added  estrogenic  component,  as  well  as hepatotoxicity in the case of the latter two agents.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1176">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The prescribing guidelines for Primobolan® do not offer separate dosing recommendations for women, although it is indicated that women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, should not use the drug. Female athletes generally respond well to 50-75 mg daily, with no signs of virilization symptoms. One would not expect a tremendous amount of <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">muscle </span>mass with this drug, and instead find a slow and steady (quality) increase. Some</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: justify;">women choose to further add-in other anabolics such as</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">discussion of potential side effects, see the Steroid Side Effects</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1174">section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (General):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Prescribing guidelines generally advise that oral steroids can be taken with or without meals. The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">10 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1175">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The prescribing guidelines for Primobolan® recommend a maximum daily dosage of 100-150 mg per day.The usual administration protocols for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes call for 75-150 mg daily, which is taken for 6 to 8 weeks. This level is sufficient to impart a measurable anabolic effect, although one usually doesn&#39;t expect to achieve great gains in muscle mass with this drug. Instead, Primobolan® is utilized when the athlete has a specific need for a mild anabolic agent, most notably in cutting phases of training.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to its mild nature, Primobolan® is often used in conjunction with other steroids for a stronger effect. In such cases, a slightly lower dose is often used (50-100 mg per day). During a dieting or cutting phase, thought to be its primary application, a non-aromatizing androgen like Halotestin®  or  trenbolone  is  often  added.  Such combinations would enhance the physique without water retention, and help bring out a harder and more defined look of muscularity. Non-aromatizing androgen/anabolic stacks like this are very popular among competing bodybuilders,  and  prove  quite  reliable  for  rapidly improving the contest form. This compound is also occasionally used with more potent androgens during bulking phases of training. The addition of testosterone,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Winstrol® or oxandrolone, in an effort to increase the muscle-building effectiveness of a cycle. While both of these compounds are quite tolerable, one must be sure not to use too high an accumulated dosage.Taken at too high a dosage, these weak anabolics can quickly cause masculinizing side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Pharmaceutical  preparations  containing  methenolone acetate remain scarce.

Methenolone enanthate offers a similar pattern of steroid release as testosterone enanthate, with blood hormone  levels  remaining  markedly  elevated  for approximately 2 weeks. Methenolone itself is a moderately strong  anabolic  steroid  with  very  low  androgenic properties. Its anabolic effect is considered to be slightly less than Deca-Durabolin® (nandrolone decanoate) on a milligram for milligram basis. Methenolone enanthate is most commonly used during cutting cycles, when lean mass gain, not a raw mass increase, is the main objective.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1178">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: justify;">Methenolone  was  first  described  in  I960.<span class="s33">1  </span>Squibb introduced the drug (as methenolone enanthate) to the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S. prescription drug market in 1962,<span class="s33">2 </span>sold for a very short time in the U.S. under the brand name of Nibal® Depot. Rights to the drug were given <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>Schering <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>West Germany (now Bayer) that same year, and Nibal® Depot soon disappeared from the U.S. market. Schering would sell methenolone enanthate under its new and ultimately most  recognizable  brand  name,  Primobolan®  Depot. During the 1960s and 70&#39;s Primobolan® Depot was available mainly in Europe, including such countries as Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Portugal, and Greece.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Schering maintained patent control over methenolone enanthate until the late 1970s. Before its patents expired, Schering had rigorously protected its intellectual property rights against any potential infringement, even in the U.S. market, where the company had not been marketing Primobolan Depot. Although methenolone enanthate has not been available for commercial sale in the United States for decades, it has technically retained its status as an FDA-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">approved drug..</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Primobolan Depot is typically prescribed as a lean tissue building anabolic agent, often used in cases where body wasting  has  occurred  secondary  to  an  operation, prolonged  infection,  wasting  disease,  aggressive corticosteroid  administration,  or  convalescence.  Some clinicians  also  prescribe  this  agent  for  treating osteoporosis, sarcopenia (the natural loss of muscle mass with aging), certain cases of chronic hepatitis, and breast carcinoma (usually as a secondary medication following other therapies). The steroid has also been used to promote weight gain in underweight premature infants and children in clinical studies, and was able to do so effectively and without signs of toxicity or undesirable effects.<span class="s33">3 </span>Athletes have long favored the combined strong anabolic, weak androgenic, and non-estrogenic nature of this drug, which makes it very desirable for building lean muscularity without side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1179">Although Primobolan Depot demonstrated a good record of clinical safety, by the 1990s Schering had grown to be a multinational  pharmaceutical giant, and was inevitably forced to reexamine its global steroid offerings in light of public concerns about sports doping. Primobolan Depot would  be  voluntarily  withdrawn  from  most  of  the countries that had originally sold it.Today,the brand is sold in just a handful of countries including Spain,Turkey, Japan, Paraguay, and Ecuador. In spite of its limited supply, Bayer has  remained  (nearly)  the  exclusive  producer  of methenolone  enanthate  in  the  human  drug  business worldwide.  In  recent  years,  however,  methenolone enanthate has shown up in a small number of other preparations,  most  from  underground  or  export-only companies.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All forms of Bayer Primobolan® Depot are packaged in 1 mL glass ampules and contain 100 mg of methenolone enanthate. Composition and dosage of other brands may</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">vary by country and manufacturer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1180">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1181">Methenolone is a derivative of dihydrotestosterone. It contains one additional double bond between carbons 1 and 2, which helps to stabilize the 3-keto group and increase  the  steroid&#39;s  anabolic  properties,  and  an additional 1-methyl group, which gives the steroid some protection  against  hepatic  metabolism.  Primobolan Depot makes use of methenolone with a carboxylic acid ester (enanthoic acid) attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified steroids are less polar than free steroids, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) methenolone. Esterified steroids are designed to prolong  the  window  of  therapeutic  effect  following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methenolone  enanthate  (in  oil)  can  be  positively identified with ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests B &amp; D. In Substance Test B, the drug should produce a slow change to purple/purple-brown over several minutes. When using Substance Test B,the drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) change to orange-brown.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1182">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methenolone is not aromatized by the body,<span class="s33">4 </span>and is not measurably  estrogenic.  Estrogen-linked  side  effects should not be seen when administering this steroid. Sensitive individuals need not worry about developing gynecomastia,  nor  should  they  be  noticing  any appreciable water retention with this drug. The increase seen with methenolone should be quality muscle mass, not the smooth bulk that often accompanies steroids open to aromatization. During a cycle, the user should additionally  not  notice  strong  elevations  in  blood pressure, as this effect is also related (generally) to estrogen and water retention. Methenolone is a steroid most favored during cutting phases of training, when water and fat retention are major concerns, and sheer mass not the central objective.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth,</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1183">and clitoral enlargement. Methenolone is still a very mild steroid, however, and strong androgenic side effects are typically related to higher doses. Women often find this preparation an acceptable choice, observing it to be a very comfortable and effective anabolic.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Methenolone is not considered a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity  is  unlikely.  Studies  have  failed  to  produce  . appreciable changes in markers of hepatic stress when the drug was given in therapeutic levels.<span class="s50">5</span></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1184">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Methenolone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandroione due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a much weaker impact than c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1185">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention. At a moderate dosage of 100-200 mg weekly,  methenolone  should  offer  measurably  less testosterone  suppression  than  an  equal  dose  of nandroione or testosterone, due to its non-aromatizable</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">nature. If used for less than eight weeks, hormonal recovery should not be a protracted experience.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Prolonged administration protocols generally call for a</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">100 mg dosage every 1-2 weeks, or 200 mg every 2-3 weeks. The usual administration protocols among male athletes call for a 200-400 mg per week dosage, which is taken for 6 to 12 weeks, which is sufficient to promote very noticeable increases in lean muscle tissue. It is, however, not unusual to see the drug taken in doses as high as 600 mg per week or more, although such amounts are likely to highlight a more androgenic side of methenolone, as well as exacerbate its negative effects on serum lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1187">Methenolone  enanthate  is  often  stacked  with  other (typically stronger) steroids in order to obtain a faster and more enhanced effect. During a dieting or cutting phase, a non-aromatizing androgen like Halotestin® ortrenbolone can be added.The stronger androgenic component here should  help  to  bring  about  an  added  density  and hardness to the muscles. On the other hand, one might add another mild anabolic steroid such as stanozolol.The result of such a combination should again be a notable increase in muscle mass and hardness, which still should not be accompanied by greatly increased side effects. Methenolone enanthate is also used effectively during bulking phases of training. In such a scenario, the addition of testosterone or boldenone would prove quite effective for adding new muscle mass without presenting any notable hepatotoxicity to the user.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The prescribing guidelines for Primobolan® Depot do not offer  separate  dosing  recommendations  for  women, although  it  was  indicated  that  women  who  were pregnant, or may become pregnant, should not use the drug. Female athletes generally respond well to a dosage of50-100 mg per week. If both oral and injectable versions are available, the oral is often given preference, as it allows for  greater  control  over  blood  hormone  levels. Additionally, some women choose to include Winstrol® Depot (25 mg twice per week) or Oxandrolone (7.5-10 mg daily), and with it receive a greatly enhanced anabolic effect. Androgenic activity can be a concern with such dosing, however, and should be monitored closely.

This agent is closest in structure to chloromethyltestosterone, which is a non- aromatizable and milder analog of methyltestosterone. In animal assays chloromethyltestosterone displayed about 30-50% of the anabolic activity of methyltestosterone,with about 10% of the accompanying androgenic activity. CMA, however, carries a 3-beta hydroxyl group instead of the common 3-keto that facilitates receptor binding, which makes it somewhat weaker than chloromethyltestosterone in comparison. Normal metabolic pathways should yield some amount of chloromethyltestosterone after ingestion, although most of the activity we see with this steroid is expected to be intrinsic. Chloromethylandrostenediol is a primarily anabolic but fairly weak steroid milligram for milligram, although it does possess enough potency to be an effective lean mass building drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1190">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chloromethylandrostenediol  appears  to  be  a  new chemical entity, although its structure is fairly basic in light of other similar steroids. The drug was first described in 2005, when a new company called Peak Performance Laboratories introduced it to the U.S. supplement market under the brand name Promagnon. This steroid product was designed by Bruce Kneller, the same person that developed the widely selling and highly regarded designer compound  Halodrol.  Like  Halodrol,  Promagnon  was considered a &quot;grey market&quot; product because it contained a steroid that was not specifically listed as a controlled substance in the U.S. It would, however, be considered an unapproved new drug in the eyes of the Food and Drug Administration, which by law cannot be sold. Although no specific  action  was  taken  against  Peak  Performance Laboratories for their sale of chloromethylandrostenediol, the company likely recognized that an FDA response would eventually come, and voluntarily discontinued the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sale of Promagnon in late 2006.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1191">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chloromethylandrostenediol  is  not  available  as  a prescription  drug  product.  When  manufactured  as  a supplement, it contained 25 mg of steroid per tablet.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1192">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1193">Chloromethylandrostenediol  is  a  modified  form  of testosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha, which helps protect the hormone during oral administration, 2) the attachment of a chloro group at carbon 4, which inhibits steroid aromatization and reduces relative androgenicity, and 3) the substitution of 3-keto with 3-hydroxyl, which reduces relative steroid activity.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1194">Chloromethylandrostenediol  is  not  aromatized  by  the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although chloromethylandrostenediol is classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. These may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Higher doses are more likely to cause such side effects. For those with a genetic predisposition,  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, body and facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.  Note  that  chloromethylandrostenediol  is not extensively metabolized by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1195">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Chloromethylandrostenediol  is  a  d  7-alpha  alkylated compound.  This  alteration  protects  the  drug  from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17-alpha alkylated anabolic/androgenic steroids can be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver damage. In rare instances life­ threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1196">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Chloromethylandrostenediol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its non- aromatizable  nature,  structural  resistance  to  liver breakdown,   and   route   of   administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1197">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1198">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">1 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1199">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Chloromethylandrostenediol was never approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable. When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, an effective oral daily dosage falls in the range of 50-100 mg, taken in cycles lasting no more than 6-8 weeks to minimize  hepatotoxicity.  This  level  is  sufficient  for noticeable increases in lean muscle mass and strength. Higher doses will impart a stronger effect, but are also more likely to present significant hepatotoxicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1200">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Chloromethylandrostenediol was never approved for use in  humans.

It differs from stanozolol only by the removal of the c-17 alpha alkyl group, which undoubtedly hurts the oral bioavailability of this steroid. In an attempt to compensate for this, an ether group has been added. The ether increases oil solubility and the likelihood of lymphatic delivery with dietary fats, which bypass the first pass through the liver. This is the same principle on which AnabolicumVister (quinbolone) was developed. In the case of Prostanozol, however, there is no oil carrier, which significantly lowers the chance for lymphatic delivery.This will necessitate a much higher oral dosage than would be needed otherwise. Among athletes, the drug is valued as a non-liver-toxic oral anabolic with properties qualitatively (although not quantitatively) similar to those of stanozolol.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Demethylstanozolol appears to be a new chemical entity. If a  non-methylated  stanozolol  were  synthesized  and assayed in the past, it could not be located.This steroid was introduced to the U.S. sports nutrition market in 2005 as a &quot;post-ban&quot;  hormone,  distributed  openly  as  a  &quot;dietary supplement&quot; instead of being regulated as a prescription drug.This is stemming from the fact that it was unknown to lawmakers at the time the 1991 and 2004 anabolic steroid laws were enacted, and as such simply could not be included in them. Although its legal status as a nutritional supplement may be in question (it is technically not found tn the food supply, and therefore not a dietary food supplement), there are no U.S. criminal laws against its possession or use (yet).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Prostanozol  is  one  of  several  legitimate  synthetic anabolic/androgenic steroid products that hit the market in 2005. Later that year, however, the FDA and others in the government angrily acknowledged that there were new &quot;designer steroids&quot; on the supplement market, and made</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1203">clear  their  intentions  on  investigating  and  even prosecuting those misbranding steroid products (drugs) as supplements. The original manufacturer (ALRI) quickly discontinued the sale of Prostanozol, anticipating FDA action. Other versions, such as Orastane-E by Gaspari Nutrition, have been discontinued as well. Given the threats  of  prosecution,  it  is  unlikely  that  a  major supplement   manufacturer   will   risk   introducing demethylstanozolol to market again. As such, this likely ended the commercial availability of this steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1204">Demethylstanozolol is not available as a prescription drug product.

It differs by the attachment of a pyrazol group to the A ring, replacing the normal 3-keto group  (this  gives  demethylstanozolol  the  chemical classification  of  a  heterocyclic  steroid).  Prostanozol contains   demethylstanozolol   with   an   ether (tetrahydropyranyl)  attached  to  the  17-beta  hydroxyl group, which slightly increases its oral bioavailability by facilitating absorption via the lymphatic route.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1205">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Demethylstanozolol is not aromatized by the body, and is not  measurably  estrogenic.

Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1206">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, the 5-alpha reductase   enzyme   does   not   metabolize demethylstanozolol, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride. Note that this steroid is relatively mild as an androgen, and much less likely to produce androgenic side effects than therapy with    testosterone,    methandrostenolone,    or fluoxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1207">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1208">Demethylstanozolol  is  not  a  d  7-alpha  alkylated compound, and is not known to have hepatotoxic effects; liker toxicity is unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Demethylstanozolol should have a stronger effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol than testosterone or nandrolone due to its non-aromatizable nature and route of administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Similar  to  dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone is a strong androgen with only a weak level of anabolic  activity.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  like dihydrotestosterone, mesterolone is rapidly reduced to inactive  diol  metabolites  in  muscle  tissue  where concentrations  of  the  3-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase enzyme are high.The belief that the weak anabolic nature of this compound indicates a tendency to block the androgen receptor in muscle tissue, thereby reducing the gains  of  other  more  potent  muscle-building  steroids, should likewise not be taken seriously. In fact, due to its extremely high affinity for plasma binding proteins such as SHBG, mesterolone may actually work to potentate the activity of other steroids by displacing a higher percentage into a free, unbound state. Among athletes, mesterolone is primarily used to increase androgen levels when dieting or preparing for <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>contest, and as an anti-estrogen due to its intrinsic ability to antagonize the aromatase enzyme.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1214">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">According  to  company  literature,  Schering  developed Proviron® in 1934, making this is an extremely old medication  as  far  as  anabolic/androgenic  steroids. Schering also states that it was the first medication put into clinical practice for the treatment of &quot;hormone-related diseasesand complaints in men.&quot;Accordingly,mesterolone would have been developed around the same time as methyltestosterone  (1935)  and  testosterone  propionate (1937),  which  are  both  very  old  agents  generally considered obsolete by today&#39;s standards. In spite of its age, Proviron has a long history of clinical effectiveness and safety, and remains in widespread clinical use today. It is generally  prescribed  to  males  for  the  treatment  of declining physical and mental capacity caused by age and subnormal  androgen  levels,  low  libido  caused  by</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">insufficient androgen levels, hypogonadism (in pre- and post- pubescent males), and infertility (in certain situations mesterolone increases the quality and quantity of sperm).</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of mesterolone as a fertility aid is perhaps one of the  most  controversial  indications  for  this  drug considering  that  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  are generally linked to infertility. It is also a use of mesterolone that is quite often misunderstood by athletes. Mesterolone is applicable here because it is an effective androgen that offers minimal suppression of gonadotropins in normal therapeutic doses, not because it increases LH output. Absent  gonadotropin  suppression,  the  drug  may supplement   androgenicity   necessary   for   sperm production. It is well understood that androgens have direct stimulatory effects on spermatogenesis, and also influence the transportation and maturation of sperm via effects on the epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminal vesicles. So the role of these hormones is not entirely suppressive. Mesterolone seems to have a unique positive influence on certain cases of male fertility because its potential stimulatory effects on sperm quantity and quality are not overridden by the suppression of gonadotropins.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mesterolone is widely manufactured by Bayer (formerly Schering), which currently sells the drug in more than thirty countries worldwide.The most common brand name used for its sale is Proviron, although Schering/Bayer has sold the agent under other names in certain markets, including Mestoranum and Provironum. Additionally, other manufacturers have sold mesterolone over the years, appearing under such brand names as Pluriviron (Asche, Germany), Vistimon (Jenepharm, Germany), and Restore (Brown &amp; Burke, India). In spite of its long track record of safety and efficacy, mesterolone was never approved for sale in the United States. It remains available in many Western nations, however. Bayer remains the major (almost exclusive) global supplier of mesterolone today, although on rare occasion other brands of the drug can be located.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1215">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mesterolone is widely available in human drug markets.

It differs by the addition of a methyl group at carbon 1, which  helps  protect  the  hormone  from  hepatic metabolism  during  oral  administration.  The  same structural modification is also used with oral Primobolan-’ (methenolone) tablets. Alkylation at the one position slows hepatic metabolism of the steroid during the first pass, although much less profoundly than c-17 alpha alkylation. Mesterolone is resistant enough to breakdown to allow therapeutically beneficial blood levels to be achieved,  although the overall  bioavailability remains much lower than c-17 alpha alkylated oral steroids. Mesterolone also has a very strong binding affinity for Sex Hormone Binding Globulin.</a><span class="s33">1 </span>This may act to displace other steroids more weakly bound to SHBG into a free (active) state.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Mesterolone  can  be  positively  identified  using ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp; B.

The  result  is somewhat  comparable  to  Arimidex<span class="s33">3</span>,  although  less profound. The anti-estrogenic properties of mesterolone are not unique, and a number of other steroids have demonstrated similar activity. Dihydrotestosterone and Masteron  (2-methyl-dihydrotestosterone),  for  example, have  been  successfully  used  as  therapies  for gynecomastia and breast cancer due to their strong androgenic and potentially anti-estrogenic effect It has also been suggested that nandroione may even lower aromatase activity in peripheral tissues where <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>is more resistant to estrogen conversion (the most active site of nandroione aromatization seems to be the liver).The anti­ estrogenic effect of all of these compounds is presumably</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1219">caused by their ability to compete with other substrates for binding to the aromatase enzyme. With the aromatase enzyme bound to the steroid, yet being unable to alter it, an inhibiting effect is achieved as it is temporarily blocked from interacting with other hormones.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1220">Mesterolone  is  classified  as  an  androgenic  steroid.

Similar doses are used to support male fertility, usually in conjunction with other fertility drugs like injectable FSH. The usual dosage among male athletes is between 50 mg and 150 mg of mesterolone per day, or two to six 25 mg tablets. The drug is typically taken in cycles of 6-12 weeks in length, which is usually a sufficient period of time to notice the benefits of drug therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Many bodybuilders favor the use of mesterolone during dieting phases or contest preparation, when low estrogen and high androgen levels are particularly desirable.This is especially  beneficial  when  anabolics  like  Winstrol®, Anavar, or Primobolan® are being used alone, as the androgenic content of these drugs is relatively low. Mesterolone can be effectively used here to adjust the androgen to estrogen ratio upwards, bringing about an increase in the hardness and density of the muscles, supporting libido and general sense of well being, and increasing the tendency to burn body fat. It is also commonly  used  (at  a  similar  dosage)  to  prevent gynecomastia  when  other  aromatizable  steroids  are being administered, often in conjunction with 10-20 mg per day of Nolvadex.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1224">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mesterolone is not approved for use in women.This agent is  not  recommended  for  women  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing  purposes  due  to  its  strong androgenic nature and tendency to produce virilizing side effects.

The dimethazine molecule is fairly unique in structure, being made from two methyldrostanolone molecules bonded together with an azine bridge. The body breaks this bond, however,  so  that  the  drug  actually  provides  free methyldrostanolone (Superdrol) to the user. Dimethazine is strongly anabolic, moderately androgenic, and not appreciably  estrogenic  or  progestational.  Although presently unavailable, this drug was once highly favored by athletes for its ability to promote solid gains in lean muscle tissue  without  excess  water  retention  or  fat  gain. Qualitatively, the drug behaves in a very similar manner to drostanolone propionate (Masteron), although as an oral c- 17alpha alkylated steroid it presents considerably more toxicity.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethazine was first described in 1962.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine by Ormonoterapia Richter in Milan, Italy. The firm sold it under the Roxilon brand name in Italy, and as Dostalon in Mexico. The Roxilon brand was also reportedly sold under license by Lepetit. Dimethazine has been evaluated clinically fora number of treatments, often including use with women, the elderly, and children. Such applications have included the promotion of growth in underweight children and adolescents, the retention of lean body mass with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, the treatment of osteoporosis, and as a general anabolic in conditions necessitating the use of such an agent. In spite of a favorable record of efficacy and safety, dimethazine was ultimately a drug that saw only limited success as a prescription agent. It was discontinued many years ago, and has been unavailable worldwide for so long that few even recognize the active ingredient as a once-marketed commercial steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1227">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Dimethazine is no longer sold as a prescription drug preparation.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1228">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldrostanolone   is   a   modified   form   of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha, which helps protect the hormone  during  oral  administration,  and  2)  the introduction of a methyl group at carbon-2 (alpha), which considerably increases the anabolic strength of the steroid by heightening its resistance to metabolism by the 3- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme in skeletal muscle tissue. Dimethazine consists of two methyldrostanolone molecules bonded together with an azine bridge. These molecules  are  metabolically  separated,  yielding  free methyldrostanolone.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethazine is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably  estrogenic  or  progestational.<span class="s33">2  </span>An  anti- estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1229">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses.This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1230">menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Dimethazine is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more  androgenic  agents  such  as  testosterone, methandrostenolone, or fluoxymesterone. Note that the 5-alpha  reductase  enzyme  does  not  metabolize dimethazine, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dimethazine is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: justify;">physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1232">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">secession.  </span>Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Note  that  in  studies administering 20 mg per day to patients for 45-95 days, dimethazine was shown to induce modest to moderate bilirubinemia (excess bilirubin in the blood, indicative of hepatic stress) in close to 50% of patients.<span class="s33">3 </span>Approximately 25% of the patients noticed substantial increases in serum transaminases. These results suggest this steroid has a significant level of hepatotoxicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1231">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Dimethazine has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its non-aromatizable nature, structural resistance to liver breakdown, and route of administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1233">section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">An effective dosage of dimethazine for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes begins in the range of 10-20 mg per day, taken for no longer than 6 or 8 weeks. At this level it seems to impart a measurable muscle­ building effect, which is usually accompanied by fat loss and increased definition. Higher doses are usually avoided due to potential hepatotoxicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1234">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">An effective dosage of dimethazine for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes would fall around 2.5 mg per day, taken in cycles lasting no more than 4-6 weeks to minimize the chance for virilization.

This agent is a close chemical cousin of dimethazine, which is also known as mebolazine (for methyl bolazine). Bolazine is a unique steroid that <span style=" color: #393939;">is </span>made  from  two  molecules  of  drostanolone  bonded together.This bond is broken once in the body, however, so this drug ultimately provides the same active drostanolone as Masteron. Bolazine is a strong anabolic agent with moderate  androgenicity  and  no  estrogenic  <span style=" color: #393939;">or </span>progestational properties. This drug, although no longer produced, was once highly favored by athletes <span style=" color: #393939;">for its ability </span>to promote solid muscle tissue gains without unnecessary water or fat retention. The results from bolazine are qualitatively identical to those of Masteron, and for all intents and purposes the two agents are interchangeable.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1237">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bolazine caproate first appeared in Europe in the 1960&#39;s. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>was developed into a medicine by Ormonoterapia Richter in Milan, Italy, which sold it under the brand name Roxilon Inject.

It differs by the introduction of a methyl group at carbon-2 (alpha), which considerably increases the anabolic strength of the steroid by heightening its resistance to metabolism by  the  3-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase  enzyme  in skeletal  muscle  tissue.  Bolazine  consists  of  two drostanolone molecules bonded together with an azine bridge.  These  molecules  are  metabolically  separated, yielding free drostanolone. Bolazine caproate is a modified form of bolazine, where a carboxylic acid ester (caproic acid) has been attached to the 17-beta hydroxyl group to slow its release from the site of injection (depot).</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1240">Bolazine is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and  fat  retention  are  major  concerns.  As  a  non- aromatizable DHT derivative, this steroid may also impart an anti-estrogenic effect, the drug competing with other (aromatizable) substrates for binding to the aromatase enzyme.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses.This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth.

Given the nature of its components, the product mixture provides a moderately strong anabolic and androgenic effect. The product is also moderately estrogenic,  given  its  testosterone  and  methandriol content.This agent is most commonly valued for its ability to promote strong gains in muscle size and strength, often with some level of accompanied water retention.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Spectriol is a product of RWR Veterinary Products (formerly a subsidiary of Nature Vet), sold only on the Australian veterinary drug market. The drug is used to treat horses, mainly as an anabolic and tonic aid to improve muscle tone, enhance recovery, aid protein assimilation, and maintain a favorable water balance in the animal. To treat an adult horse, a dosage of 5 mL (325 mg) is generally administered once every 2 weeks for a set duration. Although never marketed or intended for human use, the product  has  historically  piqued  the  interest  of bodybuilders, due to the fact that it is an unusual preparation that contains 5 different steroids in a blend. Prior to the year 2000, multi-component products like this were rarely seen, especially legitimate pharmaceutical preparations.  As  such,  the  ingredients  were  a  key marketing point for Spectriol, even if unintended by its manufacturer. Given its relatively low per-milliliter steroid concentration, however, as well as diverse competition in today&#39;s  international  steroid  market  from  export  and veterinary  manufacturers,  this  product  is  much  less desirable than it used to be.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1249">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1250">Spectriol is available on the Australian veterinary drug market.

Some references incorrectly list this product as containing 20 mg of DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which would be a third androgen. This is, however, just a confusion of the Spanish word for DHEA (dehidroisoandrosterona), which at a quick glance looks similar to &quot;dihydrotestosterona.&quot; More recent packaging lists this ingredient as the less confusing &quot;prasterona&quot; (prasterone; another accepted term for DHEA). Holding the DHEA irrelevant at the moment, this steroid product contains a simple 50 mg/ml mixture of two common testosterone esters.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1260">Many consider Sten to be a low-budget alternative to Sustanon® 250. While it does contain a blend of two testosterone  esters,  Sten  is  not  as  slow-acting  in comparison. The longest ester of testosterone it uses is cypionate, which allows testosterone levels to return to baseline  approximately  2  weeks  after  injection. Testosterone cypionate is also not a delayed-onset drug, so Sten doesn&#39;t offer much advantage in regards to a &quot;sustained-release&quot; effect. The testosterone propionate only compounds the initial testosterone spike, making its pharmacokinetic profile more uneven than if testosterone cypionate were used alone. Of course Sten and Sustanon® are both testosterone products, so given equivalently dosed weekly injections the end result should not be very different between the two.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Sten is made in Mexico by the pharmaceutical firm Atlantis,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">S.A. de C.V.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent  injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Sten is designed to provide a rapid peak in testosterone  levels  (24-48  hours  after  injection),  and maintain physiological concentrations for approximately 14 days.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1264">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1265">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1266">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per  week  for  twenty  weeks  without  an  aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1267">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

This level is sufficient to provide excellent gains in muscle size and strength. Higher doses are possible, but even the injection volume needed with 4 ampules per week (8ml) can become too uncomfortable for many.Testosterone drugs are ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids depending on the desired effect.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1271">The prescribing guidelines for Sten do not make special dosing recommendations for women, except to say that androgenic symptoms may occur, and in certain scenarios therapy should be suspended until symptoms resolve, and  after  a  lower  dose  used.

The base steroid differs from nandrolone only by the addition of a 4-hydroxyl group, the same alteration that is used to make hydroxytestosterone from testosterone.  As  a  nandrolone-based  compound, oxabolone is more anabolic than androgenic in nature, although it is comparably more androgenic than its parent due to differences in metabolism. Oxabolone is also non- aromatizable, and less likely to produce estrogenic side effects. In terms of muscle-building potency, oxabolone is weaker than nandrolone, but it seems to produce an even harder, tighter look in comparison, probably owing to the fact that it does not have the same low level of estrogenic activity. For those who find nandrolone to be a failure during cutting/hardening cycles, or prefer purer strength and lean muscle gains without water/fat retention, this nandrolone derivative is often a valuable find.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Oxabolone was first described in 1934.<span class="s50">1 </span>It was finally developed into a long-acting injectable medication during the 1960&#39;s, sold by Farmitalia Carlo Erba in Italy and Germany as Steranabol-Ritardo  and  Steranabol-Depot, respectively.This relatively mild nandrolone derivative was used mainly to treat osteoporosis, although it has also been indicated when there was a need for a protein­ sparing anabolic agent. It appears to have exhibited a very favorable clinical record, having been used effectively in men, women, the elderly, and children with minimal side effects for several decades. By all accounts, the drug was very safe.There is a great lack of information on this agent in the medical literature, however, being that it was used in a small number of markets only. As such, there is much less data to draw from than with many of the more widely used compounds.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Pharmacia acquired Farmitalia in 1993, at the time one of the largest pharmaceutical conglomerates in the world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1274">Two years later, Pharmacia would go on to merge with Upjohn, another long-standing giant in the drug business. The Steranabol-Depot brand from Germany had been discontinued  years  earlier,  but  the  Italian  product remained on the market well after this corporate transition. For several years it was sold in Italy as a Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn product. Steranabol Ritardo too was eventually discontinued, however, and would be gone by the time Pfizer acquired Pharmacia in 2003.The drug has been out of commerce for long enough now that it has been effectively removed from the black market.The dosage of this product was considerably low anyway (12.5 mg/ml), and as such was never very popular among athletes. Since this was the last remaining prescription drug product to contain oxabolone cypionate worldwide, this marked the commercial end to this steroid. Note that although this agent was unknown to U.S. Federal lawmakers before, it was added to the Anabolic Steroid Control Act in 2005.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1275">Oxabolone  cypionate  is  no  longer  available  as  a commercial agent.

It differs by the introduction of a hydroxyl group at carbon 4, which inhibits   aromatization,   reduces   relative   steroid androgenicity,  and  eliminates  progestational  activity. Oxabolone cypionate contains boldenone modified with the addition of carboxylic acid ester (cyclopentylpropionic acid) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group, so that the free steroid is released more  slowly  from the area of injection. Oxabolone cypionate is designed to provide a peak release of oxabolone within a few days after injection, and sustain hormone release for approximately 14-21 days.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Oxabolone is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic.

Note that as a 4-hydroxy steroid, this agent may actually inhibit the aromatase enzyme by competitively inhibiting the binding and conversion of other aromatizable substrates. As such, it may actually impart a measurable anti-estrogenic effect. This trait is unconfirmed with oxabolone, but well understood with 4- hydroxyandrostendione. It is of note that in spite of it being a 19-nortestosterone analog, oxabolone has no significant progestational activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1277">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities,changes in skin texture,facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Additionally, oxabolone is not extensively metabolized by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not greatly altered by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride. Note that oxabolone is primarily anabolic in nature, and is comparably less likey to produce androgenic side effects than more androgenic agents such as testosterone, methandrostenolone, and fluoxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1278">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1279">Oxabolone is not a cl7-alpha alkylated compound, and not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Oxabolone should have a stronger negative effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  or nandrolone due to its non-aromatizable nature, but a much weaker impact than c-17 alpha alkylated steroids. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1280">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1281">The above side effects are not inclusive.

The hexa hydrobenzoate ester used here is a short-acting one, maintaining steady blood levels of testosterone for only several days. It, therefore, requires a much more frequent injection  schedule  than  testosterone  enanthate  or cypionate.Testosterone hexahydrobenzoate is very similar to testosterone propionate in duration of effect, though perhaps slightly longer acting. For all intents and purposes, these two steroids could be used interchangeably. As with all    testosterone    injectables,    testosterone hexahydrobenzoate  is  capable  of  promoting  strong increases in muscle mass and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1285">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone  hexahydrobenzoate  is  an  ester  of testosterone that was first closely studied in Europe during the mid-1950&#39;s. It was subsequently sold as a prescription drug item during the 1960&#39;s and &#39;70&#39;s, most notably under the brand names of Sterandryl Retard (France) and Testormon   Depositum   (Portugal).   Testosterone hexahydrobenzoate was used clinically to treat insufficient androgen  levels  in  males,  and  menorrhagia  (heavy menstrual bleeding), metrorrhagia (abnormal bleeding of the uterus), excessive lactation, and breast cancer in females. It was also used with both sexes to treat certain skin conditions (associated with itching), psychoneurosis, and asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or lack of energy). In spite of the numerous accepted medical uses for  this  drug,  testosterone  hexahydrobenzoate  was ultimately only a minor testosterone ester in clinical medicine, and was withdrawn from the world market (as a standalone item) before the 1980&#39;s. This ester can still be found as a constituent of Spectriol, an Australian veterinary steroid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1286">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1287">Testosterone hexahydrobenzoate is no longer available as a  standalone  drug  item.

Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1289">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1290">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1291">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.

Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at ail times during active AAS administration.

It is prepared in the form of a small (aspirin-sized) tablet, which contains 30 mg of (free) testosterone. The tablet is not taken orally, but is affixed to the gums, where it transfers testosterone across the inner lining of the cheek and  into  the  bloodstream.  The  buccal  delivery  of anabolic/androgenic steroids is not new, and has been used in the past (with limited success) on agents like methyltestosterone  and  testosterone  propionate.  The adhesive Striant system, however, is an improvement over the old rapidly dissolving buccal tablets, as it is much more stable in the mouth (it stays affixed for 12 hours and needs to be removed). As such, it provides a much more prolonged  and  efficacious  delivery  of  hormone  in comparison. Twice daily dosing is enough to maintain physiological hormone levels over a 24-hour period.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Striant® was developed in the United States by Columbia Laboratories. It was approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug in June of 2003, and is indicated for use in men with conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. With this product, Columbia  was  likely  trying  to  target  those  hormone replacement  therapy  (HRT)  consumers  that  do  not welcome biweekly injections, and find patches and gels uncomfortable or cosmetically objectionable. Striant was shipped to pharmacies in late 2003, and quickly met with mixed reviews. Some patients find it a very convenient option for HRT, while others find the oral tablets too uncomfortable to use for long periods of time. Striant was released in the UK in 2004 under the Striant SR (Sustained Release) brand name, licensed and sold by Ardana Bioscience.Columbia&#39;s partnership with Ardana expects to see sale of Straint in <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>8 European markets.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_381.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1297">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Striant®  mucoadhesive  buccal  testosterone  delivery system is available in various human drug markets.Product comes in the form of a small buccal tablet; usually packaged in strips of 10 tablets, 6 strips to a box.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1298">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Striant®  mucoadhesive  buccal  testosterone  delivery system is a buccal tablet containing 30 mg of (free) testosterone.

In structure, this steroid is a close derivative of drostanolone (Masteron).The only difference in this case is the addition of a c-17 alpha methyl group, a modification that gives this steroid high oral bioavailability. The two agents remain very comparable, however. Both methyldrostanolone   and   drostanolone   are   non- aromatizable, so there is no difference in the estrogenicity of these two steroids, and both steroids retain favorable anabolic to androgenic ratios. Lab assays do put Superdrol ahead here, however, showing it to possess 4 times the anabolic  potency  of  oral  methyltestosterone  while displaying only 20% of the androgenicity (a 20:1 ratio, compared to 3:1). The exact real-world relevance of these figures remains to be seen, however. Methyldrostanolone is favored by athletes for its moderate anabolic properties, which are usually accompanied by fat loss and minimal androgenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1306">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldrostanolone was first described in 1959.<span class="s33">1  </span>This steroid   was   developed   by   the   international pharmaceuticals giant Syntex, alongside such other well- known anabolic agents as drostanolone propionate and oxymethoIone.  Unlike  drostanolone  and  oxymethoIone, however, this steroid (at least in its basic form) was never released as a medicinal product. It was only sold for a brief period of time as a modified hormone called dimethazine. Dimethazine  is  made  from  two  molecules  of methyldrostanolone that are bonded together, which are later   metabolically   separated   to   yield   free methyldrostanolone.    So    while    technically methyldrostanolone itself was never sold as a prescription agent, we  can say that the drug  was one utilized medicinally (for more information see the Roxilon drug profile).  Otherwise,  the  methyldrostanolone  molecule</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">remained an obscure research steroid only, and was never itself approved for use in humans.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1307">Methyldrostanolone was released in early 2005 as an over the counter &quot;grey market&quot; anabolic steroid in the United States. The drug was being sold without restrictions as a nutritional supplement product, barring some minimum age disclaimers by the manufacturer. No State or Federal laws identify this drug as an anabolic steroid, which remove the legalities associated with being a Class III controlled substance like other steroids.This is simply due to the fact that methyldrostanolone was not in commerce at the time such laws were written, and was unknown to lawmakers. It was never legal to sell as a dietary supplement, however, and in late 2005 the FDA angrily acknowledged methyldrostanolone was being sold on the sports supplement market. In early 2006, the FDA sent letters to the manufacturer and a distributor demanding it be pulled from commerce. Superdrol has since been discontinued.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1308">Methyldrostanolone was never sold as a prescription drug preparation. When sold as a nutritional supplement, it was generally in the form of capsules containing 10 mg of steroid each.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldrostanolone   is   a   modified   form   of dihydrotestosterone. It differs by: 1) the addition of a methyl group at carbon 17-alpha, which helps protect the hormone  during  oral  administration,  and  2)  the introduction of a methyl group at carbon-2 (alpha), which considerably increases the anabolic strength of the steroid by heightening its resistance to metabolism by the 3- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme in skeletal muscle tissue.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1309">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">MethyldrostanoIone is not aromatized by the body, and is not  measurably  estrogenic.  An  anti-estrogen  is  not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should  not  be  a  concern  even  among  sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, methyldrostanolone instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1310">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1311">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  These  may  include  a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.  Methyldrostanolone  is  a  steroid  with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue­ building  actions,  making  the  threshold  for  strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more  androgenic  agents  such  as  testosterone, methandrostenolone,  or  fluoxymesterone.  Note  that methyldrostanolone  is  unaffected  by  the  5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected  by  the  concurrent  use  of  finasteride  or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Methyldrostanolone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Note that although no human data can be found to make reference of, doses of 10 mg and 20 mg per day have been sufficient to produce high elevations of liver enzymes in consumers, as reported by private lab test results. Also, a small number of serious adverse  events  relating  to  liver  toxicity  have  been reported with the use of this substance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1312">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Methyldrostanolone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its non-aromatizable nature, structural resistance to liver breakdown, and route of administration. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1313">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.  Note  that  prolonged hypogonadotrophic   hypogonadism   can   develop secondary  to  steroid  abuse,  necessitating  medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1314">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Prescribing  guidelines  are  unavailable.  An effective dosage of methyldrostanolone for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes seems to begin in the range of 10-20 mg per day, taken for no longer than 6 or 8</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">weeks. At this level it seems to impart a measurable muscle-building effect, which is usually accompanied by fat loss and increased definition. Don&#39;t expect to gain 30 pounds on this agent (its name, which is short for &quot;Super Anadrol,&quot; is more marketing than reality), but many do walk away with more than 10 pounds of solid muscle gain when using this agent alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In determining an optimal daily dosage, some do find the drug to be measurably more effective when venturing up to the 30 mg range. Potential hepatotoxicity should definitely be taken into account with such use, however. To avoid further escalating liver strain, 20 mg daily of methyldrostanolone is sometimes stacked with a non­ toxic injectable steroid, such as testosterone for mass­ building phases of training, or nandrolone or boldenone for more lean tissue gain and definition, instead of simply increasing the dosage.The drug also works well in cutting cycles, where its lack of estrogenicity is highly favored. Often  it  is  combined  here  with  a non-aromatizable injectable steroid like Primobolan or Parabolan.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1315">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1316">Methyldrostanolone  was  never  approved  for  use  in humans.

In the athletic arena, an effective oral daily dosage would fall around 2.5 mg per day, taken in cycles lasting no more than 4-6 weeks to minimize the chance for virilization.The main point of contention with females is probably going </a><span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>be the 10 mg per capsule dosage, which is far too high to use.

This product is manufactured by Organon, and is essentially a lower dosed version of their Sustanon® 250. Like Sustanon® 250, Sustanon® 100 makes use of multiple esters of testosterone to produce a desired slow-acting effect. The different esters have different levels of oil solubility, and likewise rates of release from the site of injection. The design is such that the rapid distribution of testosterone  is  followed  by  a  sustained  release  of hormone. Sustanon® <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>00 is shorter acting than Sustanon® 250, as it lacks the longer decanoate ester, and is usually administered on a biweekly basis. This drug is ultimately very similar to testosterone cypionate or enanthate, but with a slightly shorter window of therapeutic effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1318">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Sustanon® 100 is a modern adaptation of the well-known injectable testosterone blend Sustanon® 250, both of which   were   developed   by   the   international pharmaceutical  giant  Organon  (now  Merck/MSD). Sustanon® 100 is essentially a lower dosed equivalent of Sustanon® 250, supplying the same hormone in a similar (though not exact) time-released fashion. Sustanon® 100 is recommended for the same medical uses as Sustanon® 250, namely treating male androgen insufficiency, which can manifest <span style=" color: #393939;">itself </span>with such symptoms as reduced sex drive, impotence, infertility, and bone loss.

All products are supplied in 1 mL glass ampules.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1320">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Sustanon® 100 contains a mixture of three testosterone compounds, which where modified with the addition of carboxylic acid esters (propionic, propionic phenyl ester, and isocaproic acids) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid. Sustanon 100 is designed to provide a rapid peak in testosterone levels (24-48 hours after injection), and maintain physiological concentrations for approximately 14 days.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1321">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1322">manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training, its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1323">transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">1</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">3  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the  impact  on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides,  apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">steroids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1324">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Sustanon® is designed to provide a fast yet extended release of testosterone, usually requiring injections once every 3 to 4 weeks in a clinical setting. This is an improvement from standard testosterones such as cypionate or enanthate, which provide a shorter duration of activity. As with all testosterone products, Sustanon® 250 is <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>very strong anabolic drug with pronounced androgenic activity. It is most  commonly  used  in  bulking  cycles,  providing exceptional gains in strength and muscle mass. A shorter- acting version of Sustanon®, called Sustanon® 100, is also made in certain areas (see: Sustanon 100).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Sustanon®  250  first  appeared  on  international  drug markets during the early 1970&#39;s. It was developed by the international  pharmaceutical  giant  Organon  (now Merck/MSD),  also  responsible  for  such  steroids  as Durabolin®, Deca-Durabolin®, and Andriol®. Sustanon® 250 was designed to offer a therapeutic advantage over existing single esters of testosterone, which need to be injected more frequently (cited advantages in hormone stability are probably not valid). In spite of this advantage, however, Sustanon® 250 has never been approved for sale in the United States, although around the world it is one of the most popular brands of testosterone available.The lack of U.S. availability is probably due to the high costs associated  with  the  FDA  approval  process  and  the availability of other somewhat comparable agents.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Over the past 25 years, Sustanon® 250 has probably been the  most  sought-after  injectable  testosterone  among athletes. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>must be emphasized, however, that this is not due  to  an  unusual  potency  of  this  testosterone</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_394.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1330">combination  (esters  really  only  affect  the  release  of testosterone).This is simply due to the fact that a stack of four different testosterone compounds is a very good selling point; it is perceived to have more value. In most instances you will actually get a lot more for your money with testosterone enanthate or cypionate.The advantages to be found in Sustanon® 250 are for the medical user only. If you were tied to your doctor for regular injections, then Sustanon® 250 would allow you to visit him or her less frequently.This equates to a clear improvement in patient comfort. But if you are a bodybuilder injecting the drug every week, blood levels will build to the same extremes with either type of testosterone, and the added expense is probably not warranted.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1331">Sustanon® 250 is widely available in human and (select) veterinary drug markets.

Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember <span style=" color: #393939;">that </span>anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1335">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1336">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21 %.<span class="s33">4 </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less of testosterone per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per week have also failed to produce statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B/C-IH, C-reactive protein, and insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5 </span>When used in moderate doses, injectable testosterone esters are usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1337">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression);</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise,have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Many sensitive individuals choose to stay away from this steroid completely, their bodies reacting with a pronounced soreness and low-grade fever that may last for a few days after each injection.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Men):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To treat androgen insufficiency, the prescribing guidelines for Sustanon® 250 call for a dosage of 250 mg every 3 weeks. Although active in the body for a longer time, Sustanon® 250 is usually injected every 7 to 10 days for muscle-building purposes.This schedule will allow for the higher doses most commonly applied by athletes, and more stable elevations in hormone level.The usual dosage among male athletes is in the range of 250-750 mg per injection, taken in cycles 6 to 12 weeks in length.This level is sufficient for most users to notice exceptional gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Sustanon® 250 is usually incorporated into bulking phases of training, when added water retention will be of little consequence, the user more concerned with raw mass than  definition.  Some do incorporate  this drug into cutting cycles as well, but typically in lower doses (125- 250 mg every 7-10 days) and/or when accompanied by an aromatase inhibitor to keep estrogen levels under control. Sustanon® 250 is a very effective anabolic drug, and is often used alone with great benefit. Some, however, find a need to stack it with other anabolic/androgenic steroids for a stronger effect, in which case an additional 200-400 mg per week of boldenone undecylenate, methenolone enanthate,  or  nandrolone  decanoate  should  provide substantial  results  with  no  significant  hepatotoxicity. Testosterone is ultimately very versatile, and can be combined with many other anabolic/androgenic steroids to tailor the desired effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Some bodybuilders have been known to use excessively high dosages of this drug (1,000 mg per week or more), although this practice is generally not advised. At dosages above 750 mg per week, water retention will likely account for more of the additional weight gain than new muscle tissue. The practice of &quot;megadosing&quot; is inefficient (not to mention potentially dangerous), especially when we take into account the typical high cost of Sustanon</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">250.

This 10:1 ratio has been demonstrated  to  provide  an  added  anabolic/weight gaining effect in feed animals, improving the value of the livestock. Given its estrogen content, Synovex is clearly not an ideal steroid for humans. Most athletes have only become attracted to this product out of sheer desperation for legitimate anabolics, as cattle implants like this are not regulated as controlled substances in the U.S.to spite their steroid content.

Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone and estrogen do not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1349">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Testosterone tends  to  have  a  much  less  dramatic  impact  on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids.The added estrogen in this product may further help to offset some of  the  androgenic  effect  on  lipid  values,  and  the preparation may, therefore, have a weaker impact on cholesterol  than  a  comparably  dosed  straight testosterone product.

Alternately, one may mix up a homebrew injection with the pellets.This is done by grinding them into a fine powder and introducing the powder into filtered oil or an oil-based steroid. One should remember that the practice of preparing Synovex for injection is not going to be sterile, and as such could be potentially dangerous. Note that some methods have additionally been published for removing the estrogen from the pellets, to make the drug more comfortable to use.

Both products were designed to deliver an approximate 5 mg dose of testosterone to the body over a 24-hour period, after which point the patch is replaced with a fresh one. Testoderm is an older matrix-type skin patch, which uses no penetration enhancers, so it must be applied on the scrotum, where the skin is much more permeable to testosterone. Testoderm TTS is a newer reservoir-type skin patch containing an alcoholic gel of testosterone, which can be placed on the arm, back, or upper  buttocks.  Testoderm  and  Testoderm  TTS  are designed  to  mimic  the  natural  circadian  rhythm  of testosterone release in healthy young men, higher during the first 12 hours and lower during the next 12 hours of each day. The clinical significance of this, if any, is not known.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="304" height="175" alt="image" src="img/Image_398.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: justify;">Figure 1.

The <span style=" color: #393939;">drug </span>is FDA-approved for testosterone replacement therapy in men  with  a  deficiency  or  absence  of  endogenous testosterone.TheTestoderm system itself did not make use of any penetration enhancers, and consequently is applied to an area of shaved scrotal skin, which is about 5 times more permeable to testosterone than normal body skin. Lacking an integrated adhesive, Alza soon released an updated version of Testoderm called simply Testoderm With Adhesive. Testoderm was an effective androgen replacement product, but did have the slight disadvantage of elevating DHT levels in many patients due to the prominence of 5-alpha reductase in the scrotum.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testoderm was ultimately the first testosterone patch to be developed for commercial sale. While it was deemed a success initially, it was soon obsolete next to <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>newer and less intrusive Androderm patch (FDA approved in 1995). Alza released Testoderm TTS in 1998, in an effort to retain its share of the male androgen replacement market. The new updated patch can be placed on three types <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>skin (back, arms,and upper buttocks), and has the advantage of causing less skin irritation next to Androderm. It also does not require that the patient rotate application sites each day. Since its approval in the U.S.,Testoderm TTS has also been approved in select markets abroad, although not widely.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1357">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testoderm, Testoderm With Adhesive, and Testoderm TTS transdermal testosterone systems are available in select human drug markets.

The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of  testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased  water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and gynecomastia. Testosterone is considered a moderately estrogenic  steroid.  Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  will increase the likelihood of estrogenic side effects. In such cases, an anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen  citrate  is  commonly  applied  to  prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex® (anastrozole), which more  efficiently  controls  estrogen  by  preventing  its synthesis. Aromatase inhibitors can be quite expensive in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Exceeding  therapeutic  doses  is  likely  to  produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding. Women are warned  of  the  potential  virilizing  effects  of anabolic/androgenic steroids, especially with a strong androgen  such  as  testosterone.  These  may  include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in  skin  texture,  facial  hair  growth,  and  clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor.

One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.

For physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, higher doses would be necessary to achieve supraphysiological levels of testosterone.This would require at least three or four patches per day, delivering approximately 15-20 mg of testosterone. This level is sufficient for most users to notice gains in muscle size and strength, although this is not a very realistic idea in a practical sense.

Testosterone phenylpropionate is one of the constituents in Sustanon®, although this profile concerns its use as a stand-alone ingredient.The activity of Testolent is  ultimately  very  similar  to  testosterone  propionate, supplying the same hormone over at best a slightly longer duration of release. While propionate is injected every second or third day, phenylpropionate might be stretched out  to  every  fourth  day.  Testolent  might  be  more comfortable  to  use,  as  testosterone  propionate  is notoriously  very  painful  at the site  of  injection,  but otherwise there is really no strong advantage to this preparation in comparison.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1368">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone phenylpropionate was first described in a French medical journal in 1955.<span class="s33">1 </span>A few isolated commercial products containing testosterone phenylpropionate were developed in the years following, although this never was a popular item. Testolent was the most recent preparation of testosterone phenylpropionate known to be on the global steroid market, and was marketed in Romania by Sicomed. This agent was used primarily to correct low androgen  levels  in  males,  but  as  also  occasionally prescribed in females for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, osteoporosis, uterine neoplasm, and low sex drive. Sicomed recently discounted its sale, however, and no other   products   containing   only   testosterone phenylpropionate are currently known to exist.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1369">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone phenylpropionate is no longer available as a stand-alone commercial drug product.

Esterified forms </a><i><b>of </b></i>testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following administration, allowing for a less frequent injection schedule compared to injections of free (unesterified) steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in a dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1372">help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1373">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1374">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections.The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">4  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or domiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.

Together, the two are supposed to result in a rapid increase in testosterone level, followed by a sustained hormone elevation for approximately 2 weeks. The design of this steroid is therefore very similar to Sustanon®<span class="s33">1</span>, although lacking the decanoate ester Testoviron® will remain active in the body for a shorter duration. Testoviron® was originally marketed as an improvement over single-ester preparations like testosterone enanthate, said to provide a much more balanced release of hormone in comparison.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Upon close analysis, the pharmacokinetic properties of Testoviron® are not as ideal as initially described. The problem lies in the fact that testosterone enanthate is not a deiayed-onset drug, but actually provides <i><b>a </b></i>sharp spike in testosterone  levels  24-48  hours  after  administration. Adding a fast-acting ester like testosterone propionate to a formulation of testosterone enanthate only compounds the initial testosterone spike. See the provided computer simulation of the release pattern. It shows an even sharper early  testosterone  peak  compared  to  the  use  of testosterone enanthate alone, providing the user with a greater imbalance between the early and latter days of the administration window. A study administering a blend of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">115.7mg  of  testosterone  enanthate  and  20  mg  of testosterone  propionate  confirms  this  tendency; demonstrating maximal increases in serum testosterone the first day following injection.’</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1392">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testoviron®   was   developed   by   international pharmaceutical giant Schering in Germany (now Bayer), and marketed at one time in many of the European</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">markets including Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden.

The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase,and alkaline phosphatases.</a><span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids.This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">4  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into  consideration  before  such  drug  is  added  to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or domiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  8/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1399">minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have a strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.

For bodybuilding purposes, this drug is usually injected on a weekly basis, in a dosage of 250-500 mg. Cycles are generally between 6 and 12 weeks in length.This level is sufficient to provide excellent gains in  muscle  size  and  strength.  Given  the  poor pharmacokinetics and higher price of Testoviron® and related products, testosterone enanthate or cypionate are often given preference.

This agent is a designer steroid, meaning that it was never commercialized, but developed specifically for use by athletes due to the fact that <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>was once  unknown  (and  therefore  unidentifiable)  to  drug screening.THG is most similar in structure to the European prescription   anti-gonadotropic   agent   gestrinone.<span class="s33">1 </span>Gestrinone is not an active anabolic steroid itself, <span style=" color: #393939;">but </span>does have a close structural relationship to trenbolone. Adding four hydrogen atoms (tetra-hydro) to gestrinone breaks down its 17-alpha ethynyl group (a trait that greatly interferes with binding to the androgen receptor) <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>an ethyl, creating a steroid capable of strong anabolic and androgenic  action.  THG  is  simply  17-alpha-ethylated gestrinone, a novel offshoot of the powerful anabolic steroid trenbolone.The resulting steroid is highly anabolic, moderately  androgenic,  non-estrogenic,  and  highly progestational.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1407">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tetrahydrogestrinone was first described in 2004.<span class="s33">2 </span>It was brought to light in what was called &quot;the biggest organized bust for steroid use in the history of competitive sports.&quot; These were the words of Terry Madden, Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), when addressing a group of newspaper and television reporters in a press conference disclosing the international doping scandal. His accompanying press release spoke of <span style=" color: #393939;">an </span>anonymous Olympic coach, who turned over a syringe containing the designer steroid and implicated Victor Conte of BALCO Labs in California, then credited with coaching many of the world&#39;s top athletes, as the source for the agent. The anonymous source was later identified as track coach Trevor Graham. USADA was soon amidst media frenzy, with many big names fingered for testing positive for the use of THG.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="158" alt="image" src="img/Image_413.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">For a short period of time, THG was an ideal steroid for athletes  in  drug-tested  sports,  being  both  extremely effective and undetectable on a urine screen. It was also technically legal to own in the U.S., being that it was unknown to lawmakers at the time the Anabolic Steroid Control Act was written. But with the international doping scandal that would come to surround BALCO Laboratories, any value that THG held as a &quot;designer steroid&quot; has since disappeared. This steroid was also added to the U.S. controlled substance list in January 2005. Victor Conte would serve several months in prison for his role in the BALCO scandal, due to the fact that an unknown drug like THG may have been legal to own, but it was not legal to sell. Patrick Arnold, the chemist behind THG, pled guilty to criminal charges as well, and is scheduled to begin serving a 3-month prison term in late 2006.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Tetrahydrogestrinone  was  a  designer  steroid  of opportunity,  created  from  a  readily  available  and unregulated intermediary chemical with a simple synthesis method. It would arise from the doping scandal fallout as the world&#39;s famous superstar of designer steroids. The existence of THG would be a constant reminder that the determination of athletes to utilize all available tools towin goes far beyond the abilities of the governing athletic bodies to police them. Until much more effective drug­ testing  methods  are  developed,  which  rely  not  on structural  and  metabolic  knowledge  of  the  various substances but can actually determine if a new previously unidentified steroid is being used, THG will also be a reminder that it is possible, if not highly likely, that many other designer steroids are out in the field of use at this very moment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1408">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Tetrahydrogestrinone is not available as a prescription drug product.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1409">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Tetrahydrogestrinone is a modified form of nandroione. It differs by: 1) the addition of an ethyl group at carbon 17- alpha to protect the hormone during oral administration,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1410">2) the introduction of double bonds at carbons </a><i><b>9 </b></i>and 11, which greatly increase relative steroid activity, and 3) the possession of an 18a-homo group, which gives the steroid strong progestational activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tetrahydrogestrinone is not aromatized by the body, and is  not  believed  to  be  measurably  estrogenic. Gynecomastia  remains  a  concern  during  treatment, however, due to its progestational nature (see below), especially when combined with other estrogenic drugs. At the same time water retention can become a problem, causing a notable loss of muscle definition as both subcutaneous water retention and fat levels build. To avoid such strong side effects, it may be necessary to use an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex®.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Note that tetrahydrogestrinone is an extremely active progestin.<span class="s33">3 </span>In assays it was shown to have stronger progestational activity than nandroione, trenbolone, and even gestrinone, a synthetic progestin.THG was actually shown to be 7 times more potent than progesterone itself. The side effects associated with progesterone are similar to  those  of  estrogen,  including  negative  feedback inhibition of testosterone production and enhanced rate of fat storage. Progestins also augment the stimulatory effect of estrogens on mammary tissue growth. There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones here, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins without excessive estrogen levels being present. The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often  sufficient  to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by progestational steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid,androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are additionally warned of the  potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement. Note that THG does not appear to be subject to 5-alpha reduction, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1411">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tetrahydrogestrinone is a d 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. C17- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Severe liver complications are rare given the periodic nature <span style=" color: #393939;">in </span>which most people use oral anabolic/androgenic steroids, although cannot be excluded with this steroid, especially with high doses and/or prolonged administration periods.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1412">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol. This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Tetrahydrogestrinone has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown, non-aromatizable nature,and route of administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1413">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

THG should also require very small doses, perhaps in the range of 2-5 mg per day.

Although exact figures don&#39;t exist, this designer steroid should be far more potent than any anabolic steroid commercially available, and would probably fall slightly short of methyitrienolone. For those athletes who use THG, the results should be measurable improvements in strength, muscle size, and performance.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1417">Tetrahydrogestrinone was never approved for use in humans.

As such, epitiostane is actually the active steroid that is provided to the user once the ether is removed metabolically, which is a non­ methylated    (non-hepatotoxic)    derivative    of dihydrotestosterone.  Mepitiostane  is  a  moderately anabolic steroid, which displays roughly the same anabolic effect as methyltestosterone on a milligram for milligram basis, at least according to standard animal assays. This activity  is  accompanied  by  only  a  mild  androgenic component, however, which makes this steroid primarily anabolic  in  nature.  It  is  also  non-aromatizable,  and possesses antiestrogenic properties. Although this steroid is not widely used by athletes and bodybuilders, it exhibits favorable lean muscle building properties, which tend to be accompanied by fat loss and increased definition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1420">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mepitiostane  was  first  described  in  1966,  during investigations into a series of A-ring modified androstane derivatives.<span class="s33">2 </span>The only modern pharmaceutical preparation of record containing mepitiostane is Thioderon, which is sold in Japan by Shinogi.The active drug seemed to enter extensive studies in Japan in 1974, which saw the bulk of mepitiostane research. The drug is used in Japanese medicine as an anabolic agent, and is mainly given to patients (twice daily) for the treatment of breast carcinoma and anemia associated with renal failure. In clinical trials where the agent was compared to an equal dose of fluoxymesterone (also used to treat breast carcinoma), mepitiostane was shown to offer a similar level of efficacy, but without the unwanted hepatotoxicity of a c-17alpha alkylated  agent.<span class="s33">3  </span>Mepitiostane  was  never  widely experimented with outside of Japan, and newer medicines to treat the associated conditions make it less useful today</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">than in the past.

It differs by 1<span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">) </span>the addition of a 17-beta methoxycyclopentyl ether,  which  helps  facilitate  lymphatic  delivery (bioavailability) during oral administration, and 2) the replacement  of  3-keto  with  2,3alpha-epithio,  which increases its anabolic strength while reducing its relative androgenicity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1423">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mepitiostane is not aromatized by the body, and is not measurably estrogenic. Furthermore, the drug is used clinically for its inherent antiestrogenic effect. An anti- estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not be a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is the usual culprit with water retention, this steroid instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention. This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1424">Side Effects (Androgenic):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still possible with this substance, especially with higher doses.This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1425">menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth,and clitoral enlargement. Mepitiostane is a steroid with relatively low androgenic activity relative to its tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than with more  androgenic  agents  such  as  testosterone, methandrostenolone,  or  fluoxymesterone.  Note  that mepitiostane is unaffected by the 5-alpha reductase enzyme, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by the concurrent use of finasteride or dutasteride.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1426">Mepitiostane is not a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound, and is not known to have hepatotoxic effects. Liver toxicity is unlikely.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Mepitiostane should have a stronger effect on the hepatic management of  cholesterol  than  testosterone  due  to  its  non- aromatizable nature and route of administration, but a weaker  effect  than  c-17  alpha  alkylated  agents. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely effect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1427">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress endogenous testosterone production. Without the intervention of testosterone stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months  of  drug  secession.

Given the use of an enanthate ester,  this  drug  will  exhibit  virtually  identical pharmacokinetics to testosterone enanthate, providing a peak release of its steroid within the first several days after injection, followed by declining levels for approximately 2 weeks.The base steroid here (trenbolone) is a derivative of nandrolone, and exhibits strong anabolic and androgenic properties.  On  a  milligram  for  milligram  basis  it  is considerably more potent than testosterone as both an anabolic and androgenic agent, though it does carry a more favorable balance (toward anabolism).Trenbolone is also unable to convert to estrogen, however it does exhibit notable  progestational  activity,  which  may  mimic estrogenic  side  effects  given  the  right  physiological conditions.   Trenbolone   enanthate   is   virtually interchangeable    with    Parabolan    (trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate), capable of promoting strong gains in lean muscle mass, often with an accompanying increase in relative hardness and definition.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Slow-acting trenbolone esters were first studied in 1967, during a series of experiments into synthetic anabolic steroids by Roussel-UCLAF.<span class="s33">1 </span>Roussel did not specifically investigate  Trenbolone  enanthate,  although  the  drug would  have  remained  an  obvious  possibility  once trenbolone was released given the widespread application of steroid esters (including enanthate) by the 1960&#39;s.

The trenbolone here is modified with an enanthate ester at the 17-beta hydroxyl group, so that the free steroid is released more slowly from the area of injection.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Substance Identification:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1435">Trenbolone enanthate (in oil) can be positively identified with ROIDTEST™ Substance Tests A &amp; D.The drug should produce an immediate (&lt;1 minute) purple color change with Substance Test D.

There appears to be a strong synergy between these two hormones, such that gynecomastia might even occur with the help of progestins, without excessive estrogen levels.The use of an anti-estrogen, which inhibits the estrogenic component of this disorder, is often sufficient  to  mitigate  gynecomastia  caused  by progestational  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.

Androgenic side effects are still common with this substance, and may include bouts of oily  skin,  acne,  and  body/facial  hair  growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential virilizing effects of anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may  include  a  deepening  of  the  voice,  menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and  ciitoral  enlargement.  Additionally,  the  5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize trenbolone,<span class="s33">5 </span>so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Trenbolone is not c-17 alpha alkylated, and is generally not considered a hepatotoxic steroid; liver toxicity is unlikely.This steroid does have a strong <span style=" color: #393939;">level of </span>resistance to hepatic breakdown, however, and severe liver toxicity has been noted in bodybuilders abusing trenbolone.<span class="s33">6 </span>Although unlikely, hepatotoxicity cannot <span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>completely excluded, especially with <span style=" color: #393939;">high </span>doses.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1437">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids <span style=" color: #393939;">can </span>have deleterious <span style=" color: #393939;">effects </span>on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency <span style=" color: #393939;">to reduce </span>HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>arteriosclerosis.

This adds up to a total steroid concentration of 75 mg/mL.The manufacturer also makes a similar formulation called Filybol Forte, which contains the same steroid blend but with a 5 mg/mL lower dose on the nandrolone decanoate. With its blend of methandriol and nandrolone, Tribolin is considerably more anabolic than androgenic in nature. Its estrogenic effect should also be minimal, barring the methandriol content, which is intrinsically  slightly  estrogenic.  Although  not  widely available, Tribolin (and Filybol Forte) is favored by athletes as a mild anabolic agent with low androgenic activity.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1443">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tribolin was developed by the Ranvet Company, a popular veterinary drug and vitamin manufacturer in Australia. It is used specifically in horses, usually racehorses or other animals subject to strenuous straining or performance periods. Ranvet advertises it as a &quot;powerful, triple acting anabolic  combination...  possessing  marked  anabolic properties and only a minimal amount of androgenic activity.&quot; The &quot;triple action” and Tri in the name are not referring to the formula, as it only contains two active steroids, not three. They refer to the purported benefits of its use.The three points of drug action are stated to be the facilitation of muscular development, the offsetting of dehydration, and the aiding of protein digestion. It is commonly applied to an overworked or debilitated animal in an attempt to aid recovery, and is also used to assist in the repair of muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries. For a horse weighing approximately 1,100 pounds (500kg), a dosage of 5 ml (350 mg) is usually given every 4 to 5 weeks. Treatment would often run for 3 to 4 months. The drug is presently still available, as is the very similar Ranvet preparation Filybol Forte.

Methlyandrostenediol  is  also  believed  to  have  some inherent estrogenic activity. Combined with nandrolone, which also weakly aromatizes, Tribolin is considered a weakly to moderately estrogenic steroid. Gynecomastia is possible during treatment, but generally only when higher doses are used. Water and fat retention can also become issues, again depending on dose. Sensitive individuals may need to addition an anti-estrogen such as Nolvadex® to minimize related side effects.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid preparation, androgenic  side  effects  are  still  common  with  this substance.

This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream following oral administration. Cl 7- alpha  alkylated  anabolic/androgenic  steroids  can  be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit a physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of cl 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain. Injectable forms of the drug may present slightly less strain on the liver by avoiding the first pass metabolism of oral dosing, although may still present substantial hepatotoxicity.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1449">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Methylandrostenediol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to  liver  breakdown  and  (with  the  oral)  route  of administration.  Anabolic/androgenic  steroids  may  also adversely affect blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce endothelial  relaxation,  and  support  left  ventricular hypertrophy,  all  potentially  increasing  the  risk  of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1450">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Each milliliter specifically contains 20 mg of testosterone propionate, 80 mg of testosterone valerianate, and <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>50 mg of  testosterone  undecylenate,  for  a  total  steroid concentration of 250 mg/mL.With its mix of fast- and long- acting esters,Triolandren is very much like Sustanon® 250 in design, intended to deliver testosterone slowly to a patient over a period of several weeks. In this case the slowest-releasing ester used is undecylenate, whereas Sustanon® uses decanoate. This would make Triolandren the longer-acting agent between the two, also with a softer initial peak of testosterone release. As a testosterone drug, Triolandren is capable <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>promoting rapids gains in muscle size and strength.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1455">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  Triolandren  testosterone  formulation  was  first described in the medical literature in 1957.<span class="s33">1  </span>It was marketed commercially by Ciba in 1965, and sold as a human prescription drug in various parts <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>Europe. It was used primarily to treat anemia, androgen deficiency in males, breast cancer in females, and excessive growth in adolescents. During the 1980&#39;s, Ciba began trimming their global steroid offerings in light of the new public interest towards sports doping. By the mid-1990&#39;s, the last of the Triolandren preparations were withdrawn from continental Europe. Key markets such as Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, which once were very active in its supply, no longer carried the drug, and it soon began to fade from the memory of most athletes. In 1996, Sandoz and Ciba officially  merged  to  form  Novartis.  Any  remaining Triolandren products made by Ciba-Geigy in other parts <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>the world were subsequently produced under the Novartis label. Triolandren remains available on the Egyptian drug market, although it is not commonly an item <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>export.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1456">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Triolandren® from Novartis is available in select human pharmaceutical markets.The product contains 250 mg/mL of steroid; packaged in 1 mL ampules.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1457">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1458">Triolandren® contains </a><span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>mixture of three testosterone compounds, which are modified with the addition of carboxylic  acid  esters  (propionic,  valerianic,  and undecanoic acids) at the 17-beta hydroxyl group. Esterified forms of testosterone are less polar than free testosterone, and are absorbed more slowly from the area of injection. Once in the bloodstream, the ester is removed to yield free (active) testosterone. Esterified forms of testosterone are designed to prolong the window of therapeutic effect following  administration,  allowing  for  a  less  frequent injection  schedule  compared  to  injections  of  free (unesterified) steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Estrogenic):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is readily aromatized in the body to estradiol (estrogen).The aromatase (estrogen synthetase) enzyme is responsible for this metabolism of testosterone. Elevated estrogen levels can cause side effects such as increased water  retention,  body  fat  gain,  and  gynecomastia. Testosterone  is  considered  a  moderately  estrogenic steroid. An anti-estrogen such as clomiphene citrate or tamoxifen citrate may be necessary to prevent estrogenic side effects. One may alternately use an aromatase inhibitor  like  Arimidex®  (anastrozole),  which  more efficiently controls estrogen by preventing its synthesis. Aromatase  inhibitors  can  be  quite  expensive  in comparison to anti-estrogens, however, and may also have negative effects on blood lipids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Estrogenic side effects will occur in <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>dose-dependant manner, with higher doses (above normal therapeutic levels)  of  testosterone  more  likely  to  require  the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1459">concurrent use of an anti-estrogen or aromatase inhibitor. Since water retention and loss of muscle definition are common with higher doses of testosterone, this drug is usually considered a poor choice for dieting or cutting phases of training. Its moderate estrogenicity makes it more ideal for bulking phases, where the added water retention will support raw strength and muscle size, and help foster a stronger anabolic environment.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone is the primary male androgen, responsible for maintaining secondary male sexual characteristics. Elevated levels of testosterone are likely to produce androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and body/facial  hair  growth.  Men  with  a  genetic predisposition for hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) may notice accelerated male pattern balding.Those concerned about hair loss may find a more comfortable option in nandrolone  decanoate,  which  is  a  comparably  less androgenic steroid. Women are warned of the potential virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids, especially with a strong androgen such as testosterone. These may include deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture, facial hair growth, and clitoral enlargement.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In androgen-responsive target tissues such as the skin, scalp, and prostate, the high relative androgenicity of testosterone  is  dependant  on  its  reduction  to dihydrotestosterone  (DHT).  The  5-alpha  reductase enzyme  is  responsible  for  this  metabolism  of testosterone. The concurrent use of a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor such as finasteride or dutasteride will interfere with  site-specific  potentiation  of  testosterone  action, lowering the tendency of testosterone drugs to produce androgenic side effects. It is important to remember that anabolic and androgenic effects are both mediated via the cytosolic androgen receptor. Complete separation of testosterone&#39;s anabolic and androgenic properties is not possible, even with total 5-alpha reductase inhibition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1460">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone does not have hepatotoxic effects; liver toxicity is unlikely. One study examined the potential for hepatotoxicity  with  high  doses  of  testosterone  by administering 400 mg of the hormone per day (2,800 mg per week) to a group of male subjects. The steroid was taken orally so that higher peak concentrations would be reached in hepatic tissues compared to intramuscular injections. The hormone was given daily for 20 days, and produced no significant changes in liver enzyme values including  serum  albumin,  bilirubin,  alanine-amino- transferase, and alkaline phosphatases.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1461">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level   of   resistance   to   hepatic   metabolism. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Testosterone tends to have a much less dramatic impact on cardiovascular risk factors than synthetic steroids. This is due in part to its openness to metabolism by the liver, which allows it to have less effect on the hepatic management  of  cholesterol.  The  aromatization  of testosterone  to  estradiol  also  helps  to  mitigate  the negative effects of androgens on serum lipids. In one study, 280 mg per week of testosterone ester (enanthate) had a slight but not statistically significant effect on HDL cholesterol after 12 weeks, but when taken with an aromatase inhibitor a strong (25%) decrease was seen.<span class="s33">3 </span>Studies using 300 mg of testosterone ester (enanthate) per week for 20 weeks without an aromatase inhibitor demonstrated only a 13% decrease in HDL cholesterol, while at 600 mg the reduction reached 21%.<span class="s33">4  </span>The negative impact of aromatase inhibition should be taken into consideration before such a drug is added to testosterone therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Due to the positive influence of estrogen on serum lipids, tamoxifen citrate or clomiphene citrate are preferred to aromatase  inhibitors  for  those  concerned  with cardiovascular health, as they offer a partial estrogenic effect in the liver.This allows them to potentially improve lipid profiles and offset some of the negative effects of androgens. With doses of 600 mg or less per week, the impact on lipid profile tends to be noticeable but not dramatic, making an anti-estrogen (for cardioprotective purposes) perhaps unnecessary. Doses of 600 mg or less per  week  have  also  failed  to  produce  statistically significant changes in LDL/VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein  B/C-lll,  C-reactive  protein,  and  insulin sensitivity, all indicating a relatively weak impact on cardiovascular risk factors.<span class="s33">5  </span>When used in moderate doses,  injectable  testosterone  esters  are  usually considered to be the safest of all anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s227" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p class="s228" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">William Llewellyn&#39;s ANABOLICS, 11th ed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1462">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration.

Testosterone is the primary male androgen, and offers strong negative feedback on endogenous testosterone production.Testosterone-based drugs will, likewise, have <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>strong effect on the hypothalamic regulation of natural steroid  hormones.  Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The above side effects are not inclusive.

Stanozolol  is  a  derivative  of dihydrotestosterone,  chemically  altered  so  that  the hormone&#39;s anabolic (tissue-building) properties are greatly amplified and its androgenic activity minimized. Stanozolol is classified as an &quot;anabolic&quot; steroid, and exhibits one of the strongest dissociations of anabolic to androgenic effect among commercially available agents. It also cannot be aromatized into estrogens. Stanozolol is the second most widely used oral steroid, succeeded in popularity only by Dianabol (methandrostenolone). It is favored for its ability to  promote  muscle  growth  without  water-retention, making it highly valued by dieting bodybuilders and competitive athletes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol was first described in 1959.<span class="s33">1 </span>It was developed into a medicine by Winthrop Laboratories in Great Britain. Parent firm (Sterling) filed for U.S. patent on the agent in 1961.<span class="s33">2  </span>Stanozolol was officially released to the U.S. prescription drug market in 1962 under the brand name Winstrol. Stanozolol was initially prescribed for a variety of medical purposes, including the induction of appetite and lean tissue gain in cases of weight loss associated with many  malignant  and  non-malignant  diseases,  the preservation  of  bone  mass  during  osteoporosis,  the promotion of liner growth in children with growth failure, as  an  anti-catabolic  during  prolonged  corticosteroid therapy or for post-operative and post-trauma (burns, fractures) patients, and even to treat debility in the elderly.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The FDA&#39;s control over the prescription drug market had tightened by the mid-1970&#39;s, and the indicated uses for Winstrol were soon narrowed. During this time the FDA officially supported that Winstrol was &quot;Probably Effective&quot; as an adjunct therapy for treating osteoporosis, and for promoting  growth  in  pituitary-deficient  dwarfism.  With this position, Winthrop was given more time to sell and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="322" height="157" alt="image" src="img/Image_428.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">study the agent. Winthrop was able to continually satisfy the FDA regarding Winstrol&#39;s validity as a therapeutic agent, and it remained in the U.S. throughout the 1980&#39;s and <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>990’s, a time when many other anabolic steroids were disappearing from the marketplace. Stanozolol was also showing some promise during this period for improving red blood cell concentrations, combating breast cancer, and  (more  recently)  treating  angioedema,  a  disorder characterized by the swelling of subdermal tissues, often with hereditary causes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Winthrop went through a number of corporate changes during the 1990’s, including a 1991 merger with Elf Sanofi to form Sanofi Winthrop. Sanofi Winthrop continued on to sell Winstrol in the U.S. for approximately 10 more years, before finally discontinuing the medication because of &quot;manufacturing issues&quot; (Searle was actually making the product for Sanofi at the time, and had reportedly ceased production). In 2003, the rights to Winstrol were officially transferred to Ovation Pharmaceuticals. Winstrol remains an approved drug on the U.S. pharmaceutical market, although is not under active production by Ovation label. All forms of Winstrol are presently unavailable in the U.S., although the Winstrol brand remains available in Spain. Numerous other brands and generic forms of the drug are produced in other countries, in both human and veterinary drug markets.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol  is  widely  available  in  both  human  and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary  by  country  and  manufacturer.  Stanozolol  was originally designed as an oral anabolic steroid, containing 2mg of drug per tablet (Winstrol). Other brands commonly contain 5 mg or 10 mg per tablet. Stanozolol can also be found  in  injectable  preparations.  These  are  most commonly water-based suspensions carrying 50 mg/ml of steroid.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1468">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol is a <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">modified form of dihydrotestosterone.

At the same time it displays a much longer half-life  and lower affinity for serum binding <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">proteins in </span>comparison. These features <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(among </span>others) allow stanozolol to be a very potent anabolic <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">steroid </span>in spite <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">of a </span>weaker affinity for receptor binding.

An anti-estrogen is not necessary when using this steroid, as gynecomastia should not </a><span style=" color: #393939;">be </span>a concern even among sensitive individuals. Since estrogen is  the  usual  culprit  with  water  retention,  stanozolol instead produces a lean, quality look to the physique with no fear of excess subcutaneous fluid retention.This makes it a favorable steroid to use during cutting cycles, when water and fat retention are major concerns. Stanozolol is also  very  popular  among  athletes  in  combination strength/speed sports such as Track and Field. In such disciplines one usually does not want to carry around excess water weight, and may find the raw muscle-growth brought about by stanozolol to be quite favorable over the lower quali ty mass gains of aromatizable agents.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Androgenic):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Although classified as an anabolic steroid, androgenic side effects are still common with this substance. This may include bouts of oily skin, acne, and body/facial hair growth. Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also aggravate male pattern hair loss. Women are also warned of the potential  virilizing  effects  of  anabolic/androgenic steroids. These may include a deepening of the voice, menstrual irregularities, changes in skin texture,facial hair growth,and  clitoral  enlargement.Additionally,the  5-alpha reductase enzyme does not metabolize stanozolol, so its relative androgenicity is not affected by finasteride or dutasteride. Stanozolol is a steroid with relatively low androgenic  activity  in  relation  to  its  tissue-building actions, making the threshold for strong androgenic side effects comparably higher than more androgenic agents such   as   testosterone,   methandrostenolone,   or fluoxymesterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1472">Side Effects (Hepatotoxicity):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol is a cl 7-alpha alkylated compound. This alteration protects the drug from deactivation by the liver, allowing a very high percentage of the drug entry into the bloodstream  following  oral  administration.  C17-alpha alkylated   anabolic/androgenic   steroids   can   be hepatotoxic. Prolonged or high exposure may result in liver  damage.  In  rare  instances  life-threatening dysfunction may develop. It is advisable to visit <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>physician periodically during each cycle to monitor liver function and overall health. Intake of d 7-alpha alkylated steroids is commonly limited to 6-8 weeks, in an effort to avoid escalating liver strain.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Stanozolol appears to offer less hepatic stress than an equivalent  dose  of  Dianabol  (methandrostenolone). Studies giving 12mg of stanozolol per day for 27 weeks</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">failed  to  demonstrate  clinically-significant  changes  in markers  of liver function,  including serum aspartate aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  gamma­ glutamyltransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase.<span class="s33">9 </span>Relative hepatotoxicity increases as the dosage escalates, so hepatic dysfunction should still be a concern. In rare instances, high doses (alone or in combination with other steroids) have been implicated in cases of serious life­ threatening  hepatotoxicity  in  bodybuilders.  Injectable stanozolol  has  also  been  implicated  in  severe hepatotoxicity in an otherwise healthy bodybuilder,<span class="s33">10 </span>and should not be used as an alternative medication when liver toxicity precludes oral stanozolol use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The use of a liver detoxification supplement such as Liver Stabil, Liv-52, or Essentiale Forte is advised while taking any hepatotoxic anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1473">Side Effects (Cardiovascular):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Anabolic/androgenic steroids can have deleterious effects on serum cholesterol.This includes a tendency to reduce HDL (good) cholesterol values and increase LDL (bad) cholesterol values, which may shift the HDL to LDL balance  in  a  direction  that  favors  greater  risk  of arteriosclerosis.   The   relative   impact   of   an anabolic/androgenic steroid on serum lipids is dependant on the dose, route of administration (oral vs. injectable), type of steroid (aromatizable or non-aromatizable), and level of resistance to hepatic metabolism. Stanozolol has a strong effect on the hepatic management of cholesterol due to its structural resistance to liver breakdown, non- aromatizable nature, and route of administration. Studies using an oral dose of 6mg per day for six weeks demonstrated a mean serum HDL reduction of 33% in healthy  male  weight-training  subjects,  which  was combined  with  a  29%  increase  in  serum  LDL.<span class="s33">11 </span>Anabolic/androgenic steroids may also adversely affect blood  pressure  and  triglycerides,  reduce  endothelial relaxation, and support left ventricular hypertrophy, all potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Injectable  stanozolol  has  also  been  documented  to produce strong negative changes in serum lipids. One study was carried out on a group of 12 healthy male subjects, and demonstrated a measurable reduction in HDL cholesterol values, as well as an increase in LDL and total cholesterol values, following a single injection of 50 mg.<span class="s33">12 </span>These changes persisted for 4 weeks after the drug was administered, and represent a potential increased risk for  developing  arteriosclerosis.  Injectable  stanozolol should not be used as an alternative medication when cardiovascular risk factors preclude oral stanozolol use.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">To help reduce cardiovascular strain it is advised to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1474">maintain an active cardiovascular exercise program and minimize the intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, and simple carbohydrates at all times during active AAS administration. Supplementing with fish oils (4 grams per day) and a natural cholesterol/antioxidant formula such as Lipid Stabil or a product with comparable ingredients is also recommended.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Testosterone Suppression):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">All anabolic/androgenic steroids when taken in doses sufficient  to  promote  muscle  gain  are  expected  to suppress   endogenous   testosterone   production. Stanozolol is no exception, and is noted for its strong influence  on  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular  axis. Clinical studies giving 10 mg per day to healthy male subjects for 14 days caused the mean plasma testosterone level  to  fall  by  55%.<span class="s33">13  </span>Without  the  intervention  of testosterone-stimulating substances, testosterone levels should return to normal within 1-4 months of drug secession.  Note  that  prolonged  hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism can develop secondary to steroid abuse, necessitating medical intervention.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1475">The above side effects are not inclusive. For more detailed discussion of potential side effects, see the Steroid Side Effects section of this book.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (General):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Prescribing guidelines generally advise that oral steroids can be taken with or without meals. The difference in bioavailability is generally not regarded as substantial. However, a 2016 study on newborn infants did find the absorption of oxandrolone to be significantly improved when dissolved directly in fat (MCT oil).<span class="s33">14 </span>If the diet includes considerable fat content, taking this oral steroid with meals might be more advantageous.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There can be large discrepancies in the steroid particle size  between  injectable  stanozolol  preparations.  For example, Winstrol from Desma (Spain) was designed for human use, and uses a refined powder that will pass through a 27-gauge needle. Winstrol®-V is a veterinary product in the U.S. and Canada, and has larger particles that will jam in needles smaller than 22-gauge. Solutions that utilize a larger particle size may also cause more discomfort at the site of injection. Injectable forms of stanozolol can be taken in measured oral doses should injection prove intolerable.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1476">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The original prescribing guidelines for Winstrol called for a daily dosage of 6mg, which was administered on a schedule of one 2mg tablet three times per day.The usual dosage  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">purposes is between 15 mg and 25 mg per day, or three to five 5 mg tablets, taken for no longer than 6-8 weeks. Injectable Winstrol is generally recommended at a clinical dosage of one 50 mg injection every 2-3 weeks. When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes,a dosage of 50 mg every other day is most commonly applied. Veterinary stanozolol preparations with a larger particle size will be more slowly dispersed by the body, and are commonly given at 75 mg every third day. Doses of 50 mg per day with injectable stanozolol are not uncommon, although probably not advised. Note that injectable forms of the drug are expected to have, milligram for milligram, a greater anabolic effect than oral.<span class="s33">15</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1477">Stanozolol is often combined with other steroids for a more dramatic result. For example, while bulking one might opt to add in 200-400 mg of a testosterone ester (cypionate, enanthate, or propionate) per week.The result should be a considerable gain in new muscle mass, with a more comfortable level of water and fat retention than if taking a higher dose of testosterone alone. For dieting phases, one might alternately combine stanozolol with a non-aromatizing steroid such as 150 mg per week of a trenbolone  ester  or  200-300  mg  of  Primobolan® (methenolone enanthate). Such stacks are highly favored for increasing definition and muscularity. An in-between (lean mass gain) might be to add in 200-400 mg of a low estrogenic compound like Deca-Durabolin® (nandroione decanoate) or Equipoise® (boldenone undecylenate).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (Women):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The original prescribing guidelines for Winstrol called for a daily dosage of 4mg (one 2mg tablet twice daily) with young women particularly susceptible to the androgenic effects of anabolic steroids.This dosage was increased to 6mg (the same as the recommended dose for males) when  necessary.  When  used  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing purposes,a dosage of 5 mg to 10 mg daily is most common, taken for no longer than 4-6 weeks. Injectable Winstrol is generally recommended at a clinical dose of 50 mg every 2-3 weeks. The injectable is usually  not  advised  with  women  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing purposes, as it allows for less control over blood hormone levels. Those women who absolutely must use the injectable commonly administer</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1478">25 mg every 3 or 4 days.

SARMs are all closely related to anabolic steroids in activity.They bind the same cellular androgen  receptor  (AR),  and  impart  similar  anabolic effects. However, like andarine, most are non-steroidal in structure. They are also highly selective in their receptor interactions (hence the name). These drugs are often full agonists of the AR in &quot;anabolic&quot; tissues such as bone and skeletal muscle, but only partial agonists in &quot;androgenic&quot; areas like the prostate and sex organs.<span class="s33">1 </span>As such, they should have a significantly higher separation of anabolic and androgenic effect. There is also no conversion to estrogen,  and  likely  minimal  spillover  with  other hormones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">SARMs are intended to replicate some benefits of anabolic steroid therapy, but with fewer side effects such as prostate hypertrophy, male pattern hair loss, and virilization. Many SARMs are currently under investigation as therapeutic options for, among other things, primary and secondary hypogonadism, osteoporosis, age-related muscle wasting (sarcopenia), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer-related wasting (cachexia), anemia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Some may also turn out to be efficacious as oral male contraceptive agents. Research in this area is still early, however. Though not a developed medicine, andarine is already widely in use in the sports community as a muscle-building alternative to anabolic steroids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In animal studies, andarine has demonstrated roughly comparable anabolic effect (on muscle) as testosterone propionate.<span class="s33">2 </span>However, this came with only 30-40% of its relative androgenicity. It has also been shown to increase strength and body weight similar to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), yet is stronger at preventing and restoring bone loss.<span class="s33">3 </span>Andarine significantly decreased total fat mass of treated animals as well,<span class="s33">4 </span>which is likely attributed to its pure anabolic (non estrogenic) action. What is most critical though, at an anabolic-effective dosage, andarine provided minimal stimulation of the prostate, and only modest inhibition of the HPTA. Studies like these seem to underline andarine&#39;s early potential as a therapeutic agent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Andarine has not been subject to full human clinical trials. Substantive data on the efficacy and potential toxicity of this drug is actually quite limited. Information on its real world effects and side effects in humans has, likewise, been largely based on observation and anecdote. So far, reports</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1480">suggest that andarine does produce noticeable gains in lean muscle mass and strength.This is often accompanied by noticeable fat loss. However, it should be noted that it also appears prone to adverse reactions, particularly visual disturbances (See: Side Effects). And it is perhaps not as potent or refined as some newer SARMs. As of late, this drug seems to be losing some favor to other agents of this class.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Points:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild/Moderate Anabolic Effect</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Moderate HPTA Suppression</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild Hepatotoxicity</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Miid/Moderate Lipid Changes</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1481">•   </a><span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Visual Disturbances</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1482">Andarine was first described in 2001, in a U.S. patent filing by The University of Tennessee Research Corporation.</a><span class="s33">5 </span>The drug  was  subsequently  under  development  by  the American company GTx Inc.

The drug entered Phase I human trials, with Phase II trials planned.  However,  research  was  discontinued.  This substance may have taken a back seat for more recent innovations in this space, which is now becoming quite crowded with research substances. GTx itself seems more focused on ostarine, which has been extensively studied in humans. These days, most papers on andarine look at its use in sports doping.

Though commonly non­ steroidal in structure, drugs of this class are closely related to anabolic/androgenic steroids in action. It binds to the same androgen receptor, and exerts similar anabolic effects. However, SARMs tend to do so with a great deal more tissue selectivity. As such, we can notice much greater separation of anabolic and androgenic effect. Ligandrol is reflective of this tendency.lt is a strong agonist of the AR in skeletal muscle and bone, and only a weak partial agonist in the prostate. Like many SARMs, it may hold promise as a therapeutic agent, offering similar anabolic benefits to traditional AAS, but with fewer side effects.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Ligandrol is under development as a medicine, and has been subject to Phase I clinical trials. In the first such investigation, the drug was given to healthy young men at graded doses (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg) daily for 3 weeks.<span class="s33">1 </span>The highest dose (1 mg) was shown to produce a significant increase in lean body mass of 1.21 kg, or 2.67 Ibs.This is a gain of nearly 1 pound of LBM per week, remarkable considering the time frame. Further, this study did not introduce a training stimulus, which could have impacted this finding. There was no significant change in fat mass over this same period, however. Subjects also noticed a statistical trend of improvement in leg press strength and stair-climbing power.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Early data on this drug suggests Ligandrol has a relatively favorable safety profile. For one, there was no change in liver  enzyme  values.  In  doses  that  build  muscle, hepatotoxicity does not appear to be a problem, as it can be with some other SARMs. There were also no clinically significant changes in hematocrit or EKG values.The effect of Ligandrol also appears highly selective for anabolism, with minimal androgenic activity at the sebaceous glands and prostate. That stated, the drug is prone to certain adverse effects normally associated with anabolic steroids. Most notably, it can produce negative changes to serum lipids, HDL cholesterol in particular. Ligandrol is also highly suppressive of endogenous testosterone, much more so than most other drugs of this class.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ligandrol is commonly used in the fitness community as a muscle-building  alternative  to  traditional  anabolic steroids. Here, it has a reputation for being one of the most effective yet selective SARMs available. It builds muscle efficiently,  and  rarely  causes  complaints  of  excess androgenicity. When potency is a concern, it is usually</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1489">given preference over enobosarm (Ostarine) and Andarine.

At one time point during administration of 1 mg daily, Total Testosterone had been reduced by more than 50% (over 300 ng/dL) compared to placebo. Free testosterone noticed a similarly striking decline of nearly 40%. Hormone levels did return to normal within 56 days of drug discontinuance.

Women usually take lower doses than men, often opting for the low end of the range. The drug often produces moderate to substantial increases in lean body mass (LBM). Gains are often described as being qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that of a mild oral anabolic, such as oxandrolone or stanozolol.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is typically advised to taper-up the dosage of Ligandrol, so that the user becomes accustomed to the effects of the drug.This usually involves beginning with a 1-2 mg daily dose.

Though non-steroidal in structure,   this   drug   is   closely   related   to anabolic/androgenic steroids in its activity. Enobosarm selectively activates the cellular androgen receptor (AR) in certain tissues, most notably skeletal muscle and bone. Here it supports constructive metabolism (anabolism). It is also believed to support satellite cell cycle activation, possibly outside of traditional AR binding.<span class="s33">1 </span>Enobosarm is far less active in &quot;androgenic&quot; tissues such as the prostate and  sex  organs,  however, which gives  it  a distinct separation of anabolic and androgenic effect.This drug is widely used in the sports community for muscle gain and fat loss, typically as an alternative to anabolic steroids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Enobosarm has been the most extensively studied drug of the SARM class to date. As of 2017, it has been the subject of 24 completed or ongoing human clinical trials, involving more than 1,500 participants in total. It has been under investigation in several different areas of therapy, including the treatment of cancer cachexia (muscle wasting), breast cancer, and stress urinary incontinence. To many in the fitness community, this has provided some sense of stability and safety as compared to many other new drugs of the SARM and peptides categories, which in many cases are devoid of human studies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Thus far, enobosarm has established a consistent record of efficacy as an anabolic agent. For example, in one study with healthy elderly men and women, a dose of 3 mg per day for 12 weeks resulted in a significant 3% increase in LBM (+1.3 kg; 2.9 lbs.).<span class="s33">2 </span>There was also a significant reduction in fat mass of .6 kg. Physical function, as measured by stair climb power, was significantly improved (+15%) as well. With regard to its metabolic effects, enobosarm lowered resting serum glucose levels. This reflected improved insulin sensitivity. Another 12-week study in postmenopausal women reported a similar gain of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1.5 kg of LBM with 3 mg daily.<span class="s33">3 </span>Again, performance significantly improved as well. In this case, leg press strength increased by 22 lbs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">At an anabolic-effective dose (3 mg/daily) enobosarm does not produce notable androgenic side effects.The prostate is not appreciably stimulated in men, nor are virilizing effects apparent in women. It also has minimal effect on serum free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol (estrogen), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1498">luteinizing hormone (LH). In some patients, however, enobosarm did produce certain side effects commonly associated with oral anabolic steroid use.This includes mild elevations in liver enzymes, and negative alterations in serum lipids (see: Side Effects). Higher doses are likely to exacerbate some of these side effects. Likewise, enobosarm may appear &quot;mild&quot; at this time, but is not entirely devoid of &quot;steroid-related&quot; risk.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Points:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild/Moderate Anabolic Effect</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild HPTA Suppression</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild Hepatotoxicity</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild/Moderate Lipid Changes</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1499">•   </a><span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Furthest along in Human Trials</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Enobosarm was first described in 2001, in a U.S. patent filed by The University ofTennessee Research Corporation.<span class="s33">4 </span>The drug was placed under development by GTx Inc., a U.S. biotechnology company shortly after. In 2007, Merck took a stake in GTx, in a deal that was said to be worth in excess of</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">$500 million.The two companies set out to jointly develop enobosarm as a drug product. In 2010, however, Merck and GTx parted ways. GTx regained control over enobosarm though, and continues its development track with the drug. To that effect, it has since entered a series of Phase I, II, and III clinical trials in the United States.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 2013, GTx announced that two Phase III clinical trials on the use of enobosarm for treating muscle wasting in patients with cancer ended unsuccessfully. It appears that although the drug increased lean muscle mass, the study did not meet other pre-determined endpoints involving markers of strength. GTx has reportedly decided to stop pursuing  the  drug  in  the  U.S.  for  muscle  wasting applications,  citing  a  difficult  regulatory  environment.<span class="s33">5 </span>However, they do appear committed to further developing this agent as a pharmaceutical.

A thorough understanding of its safety and propensity for side effects in humans is lacking at this time. However, this drug has been subject to extensive clinical trials in the United States. As such, there is a body of safety data to review.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1503">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In clinical studies with enobosarm, the drug was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects at a 3 mg per day dose were nausea (4.2%), headache (20.8%), fatigue (8.3%), diarrhea (8.3%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (12.5%), back pain (12.5%), and pain in the extremities (4.2%).  The  drug  also  elevated  serum  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in roughly 20% of patients, which is a marker of liver stress. Though ALT values exceeded normal in some cases, this rarely necessitated drug discontinuance. Liver enzymes should be monitored during use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Similar to anabolic/androgenic steroids, enobosarm also suppresses HDL (good) cholesterol. This was reduced by 27% in study participants taking 3 mg. Likewise; the HDL/LDL ratio was significantly (negatively) impacted. However, there was also a tendency for reduced serum triglyceride levels, and lipid values of patients commonly remained  within  a  normal  (low  cardiovascular  risk) category. The potential impact of these changes on</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cardiovascular disease risk is unclear.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Many of the side effects of enobosarm do appear to be dose dependent. For example, at 9 mg per day the most common side effects were nausea (31%), fatigue (18%), and pain in the extremities (13%). These appeared with much higher frequency than with the 3 mg dose. The &quot;mild&quot; nature of this drug with regard to general side effects is likely to change as the dosage is escalated beyond the intended therapeutic range.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Suppressed testosterone was not a significant issue in clinical trials with enobosarm.This drug appears to weakly influence the HPTA in therapeutic doses. However, this is sometimes noted in anecdotal reports from the fitness community, where much higher doses are common. This may reflect dose-dependency in this area as well. In some cases, HPTA suppression during use may necessitate a post-cycle therapy program.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1504">Visual  disturbances  such  as  night  blindness  and/or yellowing tint to the vision, which are common with Andarine,  are  much  less  frequently  reported  with enobosarm. These do transiently appear in some users according to anecdotal reports, however. As such, this side effect cannot be completely excluded. Although the visual side effects of SARMs are poorly understood, they typically do resolve on  their own shortly  after  the  drug is discontinued.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Enobosarm is given orally. This substance has not been approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable.

Drugs of this class mimic many of the beneficial actions of anabolic steroids, but are often quite removed from these drugs structurally.This often allows for much higher anabolic-androgen separation, and differing side effect potential.The objective is typically to maximize stimulation of bone and muscle anabolic effects, and minimize other androgenic spillover, particularly in the prostate. This drug is commonly used in the fitness community, as a muscle-building alternative to anabolic steroids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In-vitro studies show that RAD140 has a much higher binding affinity (Ki= 7 nM) for the androgen receptor (AR) than  testosterone  (Ki  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">=  </span>29  nM),  and  even dihydrotestosterone (Ki= 10 nM). It appears to highly favor activity in muscle and bone as well, with only a weak potentially antagonistic effect in androgenic tissues. AR receptor specificity appears high also. RADI40 does not interact with other steroid hormone receptors to any appreciable degree, barring extremely weak interaction with progesterone (IC50 <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">= </span>750 nMj.This is all suggestive of a drug with a refined anabolic profile. Such selective anabolic activity is very much in line with the clinical objective of most SARMs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">RAD140 is in preclinical development. It has only been progressed as far as animal studies at this time. During these  investigations,  we&#39;ve  noted  several  interesting findings. First, in studies using rats, the drug had a stronger anabolic effect than testosterone propionate mg for mg. A similar effect was noted with TP, but at a 40% higher dose. On the other hand, RAD 140 was far less androgenic. It required a 60 times higher dosage to produce the same prostate growth. In studies with monkeys, which are considered more clinically relevant to humans, the drug was again shown to be a potent anabolic agent. Here, the total bodyweight of treated animals increased more than 10% over 28 days. The gain was almost exclusively in lean body mass.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">RADI 40 is also widely cited as being neuroprotective. Such effects were demonstrated during a series of in-vivo and in-vitro  animal  experiments  published  in  2014.<span class="s33">1  </span>In particular, the drug was able to protect cultured neurons from the damaging effects of the beta-amyloid protein. It also  protected  against  neuron  loss  in-vivo.  It  was suggested RAD140 could offer some therapeutic benefit</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">with Alzheimer&#39;s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.  It  is  of  note  that  androgens  share  this protective effect. It is unclear how unique and tangible this benefit of RADI 40 is, at present. We would caution against drawing conclusions at this time. However, this investment on the part of manufacturer Radius does suggest more research is pending.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Several  other  things  of  note  occurred  in  animal experiments,  which  help  us  to  further  characterize RAD140. For one, only minimal elevations in liver enzyme transaminase levels were reported, even in the highest doses tested.Th is suggests it has a low level of liver toxicity. Liver toxicity is often high in oral androgens, which has been a significant drawback preventing their wider use in therapeutics. RADI40 did exhibit classic &quot;oral androgen&quot; effects on serum lipids, however. Its abuse could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">RAD140  appears  to  exhibit  a  number  of  favorable properties on paper. This could be an effective non­ steroidal  muscle  builder,  with  reduced  SARM-like androgenicity in certain tissues. However, its safety and efficacy in humans has not been established. Caution is always recommended when considering the use of new investigatory drugs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1507">Key Points:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   Moderate Anabolic Effect</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   Low Hepatotoxicity</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   No Human Studies</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   Efficacy/Safety Unknown</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1508">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">RADI 40 was first described in 2010 by Miller et al.<span class="s33">2 </span>It was developed by Radius Health, an American biotechnologies firm.The drug has since been subject to limited number of in-vitro (cell incubation) and in-vivo studies in animals, where  it  demonstrated  strong  anabolic/androgenic separation consistent with drugs of the SARM class.

It is still quite unique, however, and does not closely resemble any common anabolic steroid. This unusual structure may afford it some level of selectivity in action,similarto other SARMs. YK11 is described asa partial AR agonist. It appears to activate the androgen receptor, though in some tissues may not result in full transcribing activity. As such, it could have a reduced level of relative androgenicity.  Admittedly  though,  the  classification  of YK11 as a SARM is a tenuous one.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This drug is in an early stage of research.Thus far, it has only been subject to in-vitro (cell incubation) studies. These investigations  did  report  several  interesting  findings, however. First, YK11 did bind and activate the androgen receptor similar to traditional AAS (dihydrotestosterone).<span class="s33">1 </span>It was found to be a partial agonist of this receptor though, and displayed gene-selective activity. Its profile could resemble that of a classic non-steroidal SARM. As such, it might  augment  anabolic  processes,  but  with  muted androgenic activity. YK11 was also shown to strongly stimulate the release of follistatin.<span class="s33">2 </span>This is an important protein for muscle growth, as it strongly antagonizes myostatin, a growth inhibitor. Some AAS also share this activity, though it was particularly noteworthy in this case.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">YK11 appears to have certain favorable properties on paper. This could be an effective steroidal muscle builder, with reduced SARM-like androgenicity in certain tissues. However, not having been subject to even animal testing at this point, it is far too early to speculate on its efficacy and safety in humans. In spite of this, YK11 is popular in the fitness community, where it is used as a muscle-building alternative to anabolic steroids. Of course, there are other drugs in the SARM category with similar anabolic effects and a significantly larger body of research behind them.We recommend a full review of this category.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1516">Key Points</a></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Steroidal SARM</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">No Human or Animal Studies</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Efficacy and Safety Unknown</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1517">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">YK11 was first described in 2011 by Kanno et al.<span class="s33">3 </span>It has appeared in a couple of cell incubation studies, where it demonstrated selective SARM-like effects.

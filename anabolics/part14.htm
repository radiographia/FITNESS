These drugs are specifically manufactured for sale to athletes and bodybuilders on the black market, and are not available through legitimate channels such as pharmacies and drug distributors.These companies are unlicensed, unregulated, and operate in a completely clandestine manner. At one time the term underground steroid was considered synonymous with counterfeit steroid, but today many people view these two categories as separate. The main point of distinction between  an  underground  steroid  and  a  counterfeit steroid is that the latter is a copy of a legitimate pharmaceutical product, which was made in an effort to deceive   the   consumer.   Underground   steroid manufacturers, on the other hand, use distinct brand names that are not to be confused with registered drug companies. They often try to build recognition in the marketplace for their products, and commonly use real steroid ingredients in substantial dosages.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark241">Tighter government enforcement of steroid laws and legitimate distribution channels has fueled an explosion of underground steroid manufacturing operations over the past decade. The business model is now fairly common, and may account for more than 50% of all anabolic/androgenic steroids illegally sold in the United States. The manufacturing process typically involves the sourcing of raw steroid materials from countries where strict regulations concerning the manufacture and sale of drug ingredients are not in place. These ingredients are then smuggled into an area of high regulation such as the United States or Europe, where they are made into individual drug units (vials, ampules, pill bottles, or blister cards) with the use of small-scale packaging machines. In some cases these operations are so large they hire offshore drug manufacturing facilities to assemble their products. Such operations are small in number though, and account for a small portion of the total number of underground laboratories.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Drug Purity</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drug manufacturing safety is a central focus in Western medicine.  Pharmaceuticals  are  intended  to  treat  ill patients, not cause additional harm by being improperly dosed or containing bacteria, heavy metal, or other forms of  contamination.  Products  made  for  human consumption are only made after government approval by government-licensed companies.These companies are</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">highly regulated and routinely inspected. Their products must  only  contain  materials  that  come  from  other licensed  suppliers,  which  also  adhere  to  strict pharmaceutical-grade purity standards (such as USP/BP). These companies must also assemble their products in meticulously scrutinized &quot;clean room&quot; facilities designed to prevent any contamination from air and personnel. Each material or piece of equipment that comes into contact with the drug product must be sterile, and the entire process must result in a preparation that contains exactly and only what the label intends. In short, there is essentially zero margin for error when it comes to pharmaceutical manufacturing.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The  above  description  is  in  stark  contract  to  the underground steroid manufacturing business. By their very nature, these companies are not under government license or oversight. A majority of underground steroid products will, likewise, not be assembled in a sterile environment, or with the use of expensive pharmaceutical grade  materials  and  equipment.  Instead,  most  are manufactured in a dwelling home or small clandestine business with the use of &quot;food grade&quot; raw materials and manually operated vial/bottle filling and sealing tools.The opportunities for contamination in this type of process are  great.  By  Western  medical  standards,  most underground steroids are, of course, not fit for human consumption. Even so, many consumers still buy these products. They may find attraction to cheaper prices, higher doses, greater selection, or easier availability. Perhaps more simply, they may not be aware of the risks involved.  No  analysis  of  product  purity  specific  to underground steroids has previously been published to help consumers weigh these risks.</p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark242">ANABOLICS Undepgpound Market Analysis</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In an effort to help consumers assess the quality and potential health risks of underground steroid products, ANABOLICS undertook a detailed joint drug analysis project in April 2007.This project examined the quality of steroids made from underground facilities, and exceeded the normal scope of testing by examining a number of other variables often overlooked in dosage testing. A total of 14 underground steroid samples were selected for laboratory testing, which included products from Amplio Labs, British Dragon, Diamond Pharma,Generic Anabolics, Generic  Pharma,  Lizard  Laboratories,  Medical  Inc., Microbiological  Labs,  Nordic  Supplements,  Shark Laboratories, SWE Supplements, and Troy Labs. Included in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">this  list  were  drugs  that  were  made  from  small underground manufacturers, mid-level operations, and even  producers  large  enough  to  have  their  items assembled  under  contract  by  drug  manufacturing facilities. All 14 samples were analyzed at a registered and licensed facility in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There were four specific areas of testing for the 2007 market analysis project. The first test was to look for the presence of toxic heavy metals such as lead, tin, mercury, and arsenic. These metals all pose specific threats to health if they accumulate in the body. Those metals considered inert, such as iron and aluminum, were not included. Next, we commissioned the standard steroid quantification testing to see how these products were dosed, then checked for unknown steroidal contaminants. Pharmaceutical  grade  steroids  are  highly  pure. Unprocessed   intermediary   chemicals   or   other contaminants should not appear upon analysis. The presence of unknown steroidal substances would signify that lower quality materials (not made to pharmaceutical standards) were used. Finally, we examined the oil for other  substances,  such  as  the  flavoring  agent 2,4- decadienal.This material is common to food products, and its presence would demonstrate that food-grade oil (not pure pharmaceutical-grade oil for injection) was used during product manufacture.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The specific results for each of the four testing sets are presented in the tables below. Overall, the products examined in this study reflected poorly on the quality of the underground steroid market.To begin with, more than 20% of the products (1 in 5) contained heavy metal contamination.  While  pre-market  testing  would  have caught  this,  if  such  products  were  ever  found  on pharmacy shelves in the United States it would trigger an immediate nationwide recall. Next, an examination of basic  drug  dosing  showed  many  deviations. Approximately  35%  of  the  products  were  actually significantly overdosed. While this was likely done in an effort to produce a stronger user response and loyal customer base, this is an unacceptable tactic which raises many potential safety issues. In the third set of tests, more than 60% of the samples were shown to contain some type of unidentified steroidal compound. This does not necessarily mean the products were dangerous, as this may   simply   consist   of   inert   steroid precursors/intermediary  compounds.  It  does,  however, show that impure steroid materials were used during the manufacturing process. Lastly, testing for 2,4-decadienal confirmed that at least 14% of the steroids tested used food grade oil, perhaps the type purchased in a grocery store.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align:

7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The scope of testing for this project was fairly limited, and fell well short of the detailed analysis required to validate a real prescription drug product. Still, the standards were rigid enough for a strong majority of the underground steroid products to fail testing. These drugs did not</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">achieve a passing result due to a number of important purity concerns.The reasons being that 1) they contained toxic heavy metals; 2) they were significantly under- or over-dosed;   3)   they   contained   impure   (not pharmaceutical grade) raw steroid materials; and/or 4) they were made with food-grade (not pharmaceutical grade) oil. It is important to remember is that this analysis</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">project only covered 14 products, which is a very small number relative to the total number of underground steroid  manufacturing  operations  and  products  in existence, it is possible that a different set of 14 samples would yield a considerably different set of results. Still, the very high failure rate seen during this investigation appears to underline several important purity concerns with underground steroid products.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Legitimate pharmaceutical products are manufactured under strict conditions for a reason. It is very difficult to maintain an acceptable level of purity without them. Even if pure USP/BP grade materials are being used, it can be very easy for a microscopic biological pathogen or other contaminant to enter a solution unless every single potential  source  of  contamination  is  addressed. Underground manufacturers have little financial incentive</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">(or  often  logistical  possibility)  to  make  their  drugs according to these strict purity standards. Instead, a lower quality  (&quot;food  grade&quot;)  level  of  manufacturing  may dominate the underground market. There are likely few exceptions, involving only the largest and most reputable underground operations. While the number of anecdotal reports  of  injury  from  underground  steroid  products appears to be relatively low overall, and admittedly a substantial dose of alcohol in solution will kill most biological contaminants, consumers must be aware that there  remains  a  high  likelihood  of  impurity  with underground drugs. By the very nature of these products purity cannot be assured, and results like those of the ANABOLICS Underground Market Analysis only further highlight this. In general, underground steroids should not  be  considered  equal  substitutes  for  licensed pharmaceuticals.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Designer Steroids</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There is a fatal flaw in the steroid detection methods used by the various sports agencies. That is, in order to test someone for anabolic steroids, you need to know exactly what you are looking for. You can&#39;t just look for &quot;steroids&quot; in the urine, but are forced to test for each specific compound  individually.  To  make  things  even  more complicated,you need to know more than just what these steroids look like chemically before they are administered. You need to know what they are going to look like by the time they appear in the urine, because the original steroids themselves will largely be metabolized into other compounds. For example, nandrolone use is most easily detected  by  looking  for  its  major  metabolites  19- norandrosterone  and  19-noretiocholanolone,<span class="s33">23   </span>not nandrolone  itself.  With  this  in  mind,  you  need  to investigate each potential steroid of &quot;misuse&quot; very closely, and each plan of detection is going to be difficult, and time-consuming, to develop. The past couple of decades have seen a lot of progress in identifying the metabolites unique to most commercially available synthetic steroids. As a result, they are almost all detectable in a urine sample now. In reality, this may still only be a drop in the bucket</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">You see, several hundred, if not a thousand or more, different steroids were synthesized and investigated in various laboratories around the world during the heyday of steroid research. In most cases, their anabolic and androgenic potencies were measured, with the same methods that have been used on all of the popular steroids we know today. Only a minute fraction of these research  compounds  ultimately  became  commercially available  drug  products,  leaving  many  potentially excellent steroids by the wayside.This is to be expected in any area of drug research though, as there would be no way for hundreds of similar drugs to exist in the same market. But the early research is still out there, and remains a very valuable source of information for the clever chemists of today.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Some of these old research steroids of the &#39;50s and &#39;60s still exist today, due to the diligence of underground chemists and researchers. We refer to these drugs collectively as &quot;Designer Steroids&quot; and they are here only for the purpose of defeating a drug screen. A true designer steroid is structurally unique next to the known anabolic/androgenic  steroids,  sharing  no  common metabolites, so as to be undetectable to even the most thorough steroid test. The thought of tracking down metabolites  for  all  possible  steroids  compounds,  to eliminate the designer steroids issue, seems like an</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">impossible task to say the least. Even if somehow this old research were to be exhausted,and metabolites identified for all known steroids, there are still nearly limitless other ways   to   alter   testosterone,   nandrolone,   or dihydrotestosterone to make unique new steroids. The designer steroid phenomena could obviously present an overwhelming problem to the sports organizations given present drug testing methods.The athletes can easily stay one or two steps ahead, and nobody on the sidelines is the wiser.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">At this point in time, the fact that designer steroids exist is no secret to the sports agencies. It became painfully obvious to the IOC (International Olympic Committee) in March of 2002, when the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab detected norbolethone, a potent c-17 alpha alkylated nandrolone derivative investigated back in the 1960s, in the urine samples from a female athlete<span class="s33">24</span>(see Drug Profiles: Norbolethone).  It turned out to be Tammy Thomas, a 32-year-old cyclist from Colorado Springs.This was the second time she failed a drug test actually, which resulted in a lifetime ban from competition. One of the samples in question was actually flagged previously, with a  group  of  others,  because  it  had  extremely  low endogenous   steroid   concentrations   (suggesting suppression from exogenous steroid administration). Don Catlin, who runs the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, would connect it to the designer steroid norbolethone much later. The fact that only one of these samples retroactively tested positive suggests that other designer steroids were being used by competitors in addition to norbolethone.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Catlin was able to obtain a sample of pure norbolethone from the drug company Wyeth, and must have been greatly aided by the fact that metabolites of this steroid had been identified in earlier studies.<span class="s33">25 </span>The procedure for norbolethone detection has now been made available to all testing agencies, and unfortunately it is now unsafe for competition. Its value as a designer steroid has likewise vanished overnight. Perhaps it was a bad idea to use a steroid that actual made it all the way to the point of clinical trials in the U.S., as there is quite a bit of information to be found on it (not having the urinary metabolites study would have made things a lot harder on Catlin). Honestly, I can think of a number of more effective and safer compounds to use than this hideously progestational one (ooh, the water bloat). I don&#39;t think the chemist  was  really  thinking  this  one  through  very thoroughly, and next time may want to get some help</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">from someone that really knows these agents.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  norbolethone  story  quietly  fell  from  the  public conscience not long after it broke.The number of athletes that ultimately tested positive for the drug was minimal, so it really never evolved into the big scandal that was initially expected. The USADA thrives on negative media attention  to  steroids,  because  it  leads  to  more government funding, so no doubt this lack of public outrage was a disappointment. I would suspect many Involved were hoping for the global story on par with what happened when Ben Johnson was stripped of his gold medal during the 1988 summer Olympics.This would be of little matter by January 2004, however, because a much bigger doping scandal was about to hit. It involved the use of the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (see Drug Profiles:THG),and this time would snare some of the biggest figures in amateur and professional sports. Not just Olympic competitors, but professional football and baseball players were being listed as potential violators. Many  household  names  were  being  thrown  around, including Jason Giambi, Barry Bonds, and Gary Scheffield. Over 20 athletes ultimately tested positive for THG, or were specifically named for using it in the evidence. The investigation continues today, so this number may rise. Don Catlin was once again the scientist who helped identify this compound in the first place, as well as a method of its detection in urine. This time around, however, he had a lot more help then he did with norbolethone. THG was actually handed over to the IOC testing laboratory in a syringe, by an anonymous coach who did not approve of its use. With the help of an inside informant, USADA got their Ben Johnson story, and then some. THG was at the center of the biggest organized</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">doping scandal in the history of competitive sports, and would come to spark a more vigorous government fight against steroid use than we had yet seen. The steroid- using community is only now beginning to feel the backlash.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">I include these stories not because they illustrate victories for the IOC. Quite the contrary,! believe they underline the major failings in current steroid testing methods. These two incidents logically do not represent the only two designer steroids ever used in competitive sports. For one, we surely cannot expect a 100% success rate for the IOC when we know that THG use went completely unnoticed for months, if not years. Nobody knew anything about this steroid until a sample was handed over to the testing facility, which is the same facility that had unwittingly been passing urine samples containing the same steroid just days before. Were it not for the inside source, THG would probably still be in use today. The norbolethone and THG stories spit in the face of those on the sidelines, who insist that drug testing ensures their favorite athlete is drug free. The fact is, many other potent designer steroids are probably out there, either in the books, or in the gym bags, of many of the world&#39;s top competitors. It may take years for the next designer compound to be identified by the IOC labs, and perhaps only a matter of weeks for a new one to be synthesized once it is. It is a game the drug testers simply cannot win given the tools they have available to them now. We may see repeats of these scandals in the future, but such events will only exemplify the proficiency of those working against drug testing. They show the public the unshakable will of the athletes who are going to use these agents, not the testing agencies that police them.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anabolic Steroids and the Law</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">United States law prohibits the possession of anabolic steroids without a legal medical prescription, imparting severe penalties (including fine and/or imprisonment) for those that choose to violate these laws.

L. No. 101-647, Sec. 1902,104 Stat. 4851,1990).This law makes it a criminal offense to sell, distribute, manufacture, or possess  anabolic  steroids  without  proper  legal authorization.  The  outlined  penalties  for  possession</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">without a legal prescription include a maximum of 1 year of imprisonment and/or a minimum fine of $1,000.

Note that this law was amended in 2005 following passage of the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004.

It places no judgment on the decision itself, and concentrates only on reducing risks relating  to  the  drug  supply.  How  one  goes  about obtaining these substances is an extremely important consideration. Much more than money is at stake with this decision. The illicit market for anabolic steroids can be a highly volatile place, with significant quantities of low quality counterfeit and underground drugs in circulation. In this section we will review the four general sources for anabolic steroids. When possible, we examine tips that should increase, at least to some small extent, relative safety for the buyer. The main objective in all cases is to obtain legitimate pharmaceutical grade products so that no  additional  risks  due  to  contamination,  drug substitution, or inaccurate dosing are presented to the user.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By Prescription</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Provided you are in some way in valid need of therapy, it is always preferable to obtain anabolic steroids through a physician&#39;s  prescription.  In  addition  to  offering  the potential benefit of having some medical oversight to your use, most pharmaceutical markets (in Western nations especially) are very secure. It is unlikely that you will  come  across  counterfeit  drugs  when  your medications are dispensed from a real pharmacy. In the United States, in fact, the risk is so low that it is not even worth considering. Furthermore, if you reside in a country where there are criminal penalties for the unapproved possession of steroids, a prescription is the only way to legally own and use these substances. The criminal and civil penalties can be very serious in many cases, even when the drugs are for personal use.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Most  readers  are  probably  under  the  incorrect assumption  that  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  get  a prescription for anabolic steroids in the United States. While this may have been true following the doping scandals of the late 1980s, the market has changed considerably since then. The legal sale of these drugs is again on the rise.The shift began in the mid-1990s, when drug companies started to put forth a strong effort to educate physicians and the public on the use of steroids (specifically testosterone) to treat age-related hormone deficiency in men.lt is a fact that men deal with hormonal decline just like women do, and suffer ill health effects from it.Treating hormonal deficiency with drugs to restore youthful  testosterone  levels  has  become  a  widely</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">accepted part of medicine. By the time men hit their thirties, a high percentage are legitimate candidates for hormone replacement treatment.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">If you feel that you are a candidate for a prescription, you may need to take an active role in finding a physician. Unfortunately, many doctors are still unsure about these drugs.They might not prescribe testosterone at all, or may be too conservative in their treatment if they do. You may have to interview several before you find the one that is right for you. Don’t worry about &quot;doctor shopping” This illegal  practice  involves  seeing  multiple  doctors,  or withholding information, to gain prescriptions you don&#39;t need, You should never lie to your doctor, or try and gain prescriptions from more than one at a time. Otherwise, it is perfectly legal to take the time to find one you feel comfortable with.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Medical necessity is usually supported with a blood test, ordered by the treating physician. Testosterone levels tend to be highest in the morning and lowest at the end of the day. The blood test should be planned accordingly. Before reviewing the results, understand that there are no specific  established  protocols  for  treating  men  with hormone deficiency. The medical community does not even agree on the point in which therapy should be initiated. For example, the&quot;normal” level of testosterone in an adult man is 250-1,200 ng/dL.Some physicians will not prescribe anything to you unless you are symptomatic and  your  levels  fall  below  250  ng/dL.  Others  are comfortable prescribing even if your levels read 500 ng/dL, the objective being to maintain hormonal levels at the high end of normal (&quot;optimal&#39;&#39;). Note that some people choose to pre-test themselves to determine how they might quality before approaching a physician.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">How testosterone medication is prescribed also varies a great deal depending on not only the needs of the patient, but also the comfort level of the physician. For example, more rigid physicians will often only prescribe testosterone gels or patches. This is because these forms allow the very controlled daily release of testosterone, and are harder for the patient to abuse. Other doctors are comfortable working with testosterone injections that are taken home and self-administered by the patient. Even when  testosterone  injections  are  prescribed,  some doctors refuse to give more than 100 mg per week. Others routinely give a 200 mg per week dose, assuring that low levels are not endured at any point during treatment. You will not need to find a crooked doctor. You just want to find a progressive physician that understands the value of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">optimizing your hormone levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">You have a few options open to you when first seeking treatment. You can approach your family doctor, a hormone specialist (endocrinologist), or an anti-aging physician. In my experience, anti-aging medicine is where you find the most progressive physicians and treatments. These are the doctors that are working with both steroids and off-label medications like anti-estrogens and growth hormone,  and  forcing  the  establishment  to  rethink hormonal medicine. Doctors in this field are often certified by private physician groups such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M), which lobby the FDA and help establish effective protocols for HRT/anti- aging doctors. Don&#39;t expect any anti-aging physician to support drug abuse. Like all doctors, they take an oath to protect their patients. It is not unreasonable, however, to find a good anti-aging physician that will work closely with  you  to  keep  you  healthy,  physically  fit,  and hormonally optimized.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark259">One benefit to being a writer and educator on anabolic substances is that </a><span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>am regularly meeting progressive physicians and hormone clinic owners. I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know a great many over the years. It has given me confidence that this field of medicine is here to stay, if not continuing to grow rapidly. It occurred to me that my list of contacts puts me in a unique position to help potential HRT/anti-aging patients. Male testosterone deficiency is grossly under-treated in this country. I&#39;d like to do my part to help change this. If you are interested in consulting with a doctor in your area, please visit my free website below. I will use it as a portal to put visitors in contact with HRT/anti-aging physicians. If you think HRT may be an option for you, I strongly encourage you to explore it further, regardless of how you go about seeking treatment. Supporting the physicians that offer this type of treatment is the best way to help legitimize and advance this area of medicine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ordering Steroids in the Mail</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Unlike most traditional drugs that are under strict legal controls (such as narcotics), the sale of anabolic steroids seem to be openly advertised on the Internet and in the back pages of bodybuilding magazines. Much of this probably has to due with the strong variance in laws between countries. In particular, many countries without close  ties  to  the  United  States  find  little  need  to criminalize these drugs. Steroid prohibition is largely a western concept. As such, a situation exists where many markets have weak regulatory controls on these drugs. This helps to maintain an active global supply. As such, much  international  commerce  still  takes  place  with anabolic steroids. While it might not be a simple task to take out your credit card and order other illegal drugs</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">over the Internet, it is still fairly easy to shop for anabolic steroids this way.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The first major difference between obtaining anabolic steroids via prescription and ordering them through the mail (illegally) is that you may not receive genuine pharmaceutical products. The potential health risks of counterfeit drugs are significant, and detailed in other sections of this book. Counterfeiting is serious and widespread.  The  World  Health  Organization  recently warned that more than half of all drugs ordered over the Internet from unlicensed pharmacies are illegitimate. The rampant problem of counterfeiting is likely no better exemplified than it is with anabolic steroids. With the large lucrative  markets  and  steadily  increasing  demand, steroids  have  been  highly  attractive  targets  of counterfeiters for decades now. The cited WHO statistics undoubtedly underestimate the problem as it relates to the counterfeiting of steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Below are several rules to follow when ordering steroids through the mail. These rules can help increase the chances that your order will contain pharmaceutical grade drug products.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">1.    Order from a country with legal access to steroid medications. If it is easy for your source to get legitimate products, it is likely what is sent to you will be legitimate. Avoid ordering from countries with strict prohibitive laws such as the United States, Canada, Western Europe, or Australia. Consistent supply in these areas invariably involves  the  sourcing  of  clandestinely  manufactured products.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">2.    Buy local brand drugs from the chosen source country. If you are ordering from a pharmacy in Thailand, buy Thai drugs. The chances of running into counterfeits will increase significantly when the drugs you buy are not domestic to the supplier&#39;s country.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">3.    Immediately avoid any foreign pharmacy that says it carries American steroid products. These will be counterfeit over 99% of the time, which means the pharmacy probably deals in counterfeit drugs.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">4.    Buy from a place that shows pictures of its products. Scrutinize the offerings closely. Are there any known fakes? Many suppliers work hard to keep their company clear from counterfeit drugs. You want to deal with one of these.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The purpose of this book is to reduce harm, not encourage or support criminal activity. Thus the previous rules address only the validity of the drugs, not smuggling them. If you reside in an area where steroids are illegal to import without a prescription such as the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, or Australia, you need to be aware that there can be serious legal consequences to ordering</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark260">these drugs through the mail. If authorities intercept your package, you may be charged with a variety of crimes including drug possession and illegal importation. You may even be charged with trafficking if the quantity is large enough. While in the United States many individuals receive only a seizure notice when their steroids are discovered, the police visit and arrest many others. Being forced into the legal justice system is not the outcome you want. Please consider this carefully before you order steroids through the mail.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Purchasing Steroids on Vacation</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Another common option is to travel to a country where anabolic steroids are widely available, and purchase the drugs directly from a pharmacy. Many popular vacation spots are common sources, including Mexico, Thailand, and Turkey. So it is not uncommon to see dual-purpose trips  (vacation/sourcing),  with  the  individual  bringing back only a small personal use supply. As with all illicit sourcing options, there are some benefits and drawbacks to  this  practice.  The  principle  benefit,  provided  the individual  chooses  the  right  country  and  shops intelligently, should be more consistent access to real pharmaceutical grade compounds, and the chance for inspection before purchase.The main drawback, of course, is that you will be required to clear Customs upon your return. If you are found to be in possession of the drugs while  attempting  to  enter  a  country  with  steroid prohibition laws, you could face serious criminal charges.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In an effort to help readers avoid the added risks of counterfeit drug products, the following points of advice are provided. All readers are cautioned that smuggling is illegal and can be a very risky practice. Again, since this book is about harm reduction we will not be discussing means of smuggling.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">1.    Loose regulations on the steroid supply typically also mean loose oversight of pharmacies. In some countries, pharmacies in tourist areas will commonly stock counterfeits. You should become well-versed with the products of a particular region before traveling.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">2.    Always buy local. You want to get the drugs that are readily available to pharmacies through normal legal channels, not exotic drugs that may or may not have been legally imported by the pharmacy. For example, never buy European or American drugs in a Mexican pharmacy.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">3.    If possible, avoid the obvious tourist pharmacies. Travel to an area more known to the locals. The smaller a percentage of business the pharmacy makes on tourists, the less likely they are to be stocking counterfeits.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">4.    Ask for products by name. Most tourists stumble in and ask for &quot;steroids, anabolicas, testosterona.” If</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark261">instead you ask for something very specific, such as &quot;Bayer Primoteston,&quot; you are probably going to be taken more seriously.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Local Black Market</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Where steroids are difficult to obtain through legitimate channels, robust trade usually continues on a black market.The United States in particular has the largest and most lucrative steroid black market in the world. If you plan to obtain anabolic steroids this way, you should be aware of its unique drawbacks and advantages.To begin with, unlike ordering over the Internet, purchasing in person from a local black market dealer should allow you an opportunity to inspect products before purchasing. You also do not have to deal with the uncertainty and wait of ordering through the mail. On the other hand, however, strict criminal laws may seriously limit the diversion of real steroid drugs to the black market. The United States has some  of  the  most  pronounced  issues  with  drug contamination, adulteration, and mislabeling because of this. You should know that of all the options available to you, purchasing on the black market could be the most risky,  especially  if  you  do  not  have  experience differentiating real from counterfeit drugs.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Again, our focus in this section is only on increasing the likelihood  of  obtaining  real  pharmaceutical  products. Towards that objective, the following points of advice should be followed when shopping on the local black market.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">1.    Consider the country of origin for each drug. Only buy drugs that make sense. For example, Mexican steroids are common in the United States due to their open supply and close proximity. You would expect to see them. On the other hand, you are very unlikely to find legitimate drugs from Australia in the United States, which is very far away and also seriously restricts its own steroid supply.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2.    Try to stick with a group of fellow steroid users. Sharing experiences and knowledge can help keep the group better supplied with legitimate medications.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">3.    Try to buy from other steroid users. Individuals who sell steroids but don&#39;t use them are probably less concerned with product quality.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">4.     If  you  are  trying  to  purchase  legitimate pharmaceutical products, don&#39;t buy multi-dose vials or bottles with loose pills unless you are absolutely sure of the company and source. These forms of medication are rarely used outside of the U.S. and Canada. Single use ampules and push through pill blisters are much more common in other countries, and may be slightly more secure due to the difficulty involved in making them.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark262">Intramuscular Abscess</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Occasionally,  bodybuilders  develop  intramuscular abscesses, septic and sterile.The main difference between them is that the former develops the clinical symptoms of inflammation and deals with infection, while the later deals with hard lumps of oily solutions. In the long term, they get calcified and turn into scar tissue. Common areas of  abscess  include  the  buttocks  (gluteus  maximus), shoulders  (deltoid),  chest  (pectorals),  and  calves (gastrocnemius).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Septic abscess is a result of contaminated injectable steroid  solutions  or  non-sterile  injection  techniques (needle sharing, reusing needles and syringes). An oily solution is a hostile environment for bacterial growth. Even so, underground-prepared injectable solutions are rarely assembled under sterile conditions.These are often contaminated  with  bacteria.  Water-based  suspension solutions, such as stanozolol, testosterone, and recently trenbolone base, can be even worse. Bacteria are very likely to get cultivated in such solutions, as water is an ideal  environment.  Water-based  injectables  are  the highest risk AAS products for bacterial contamination.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Location of injectable may also play a role. Thigh abscesses, pectoral and deltoid abscess have been reported  in  bodybuilders  using  &#39;spot  shots&#39;  or  &#39;site locations&#39;, which are local injections into a specific muscle. This practice is believed to increase isolated muscle growth.  Gluteal  abscesses  have  also  occurred  in contaminated products. Administration of large volumes of testosterone esters in one injection (up to 5 mL) is also common, and can expose an individual to sterile abscess formation,  where  a  pathogenic  organism  cannot  be found.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Reported infections associated with AAS injection include abscesses attributable to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas and atypical Mycobacteria.The basic signs of inflammation process include: 1) local swelling-edema</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">2) erythema 3) elevated temperature/ pyrexia and 4) pain. All of these symptoms take place due to the increased blood  flow,  since  macrophages  and  neutrophils  are among the white blood cells responsible for phagocytosis of microorganisms. An abscess is a defensive reaction of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. Besides clinical and laboratory findings  [leukocytosis  with  increased  neutrophils, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C- reactive protein (CRP)], a useful laboratory examination that reveals the existence of intramuscular abscess is the Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI), ideal for the soft tissues</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(muscles, joints, ligaments, tendons).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Abscesses should never be squeezed by the person concerned. If the abscess burst under the skin and the bacteria spread through the blood circulation into the body, it can result in a life-threatening blood infection such as sepsis. Sepsis symptoms include general malaise, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachypnea, and confusion. Sepsis always requires hospitalization. Initially the steroid user should avoid injecting into the inflamed area, while rotating the injection spots. Discontinuing injections at least for one week, will give some time for the immune  system  to  suppress  the  intramuscular inflammation. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs (sodium diclophenac, nimesulide) could provide some aid in first place and fight discomfort. Furthermore, hypertonic solution based on aluminum, provides pain relief when applied locally with a wet towel for about 10 minutes 4 times daily. A pharmaceutical medication that has a significant role in order to prevent further edema is the rerapeptase drug.This drug is widely used in several cases that include septic, or non septic inflammation, where excessive swelling is present. Finally, the danaparoid sodium cream is a helpful material,able to suppress edema, thus providing a relief feeling.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">However,sometimes inflammation process is more severe and complicated and pus develops in the intramuscular abscess. Pus contains dead white blood cells, trying to control  the  inflammation.  In  the  beginning,  an intramuscular infection is reddish and sort of hard in touch. Later, as the inflammation proceeds and pus is gathered, it becomes softer. Usually surgeons find this a warning sign, where surgical incision and drainage is obligatory.The surgeon cuts the skin and fat beneath with a scalpel, entering the inflamed muscle.This will give the opportunity for the drug (oily) solution and pus to leave the contaminated area, which has to be excessively cleaned afterwards. As soon as the pus has drained, the surgeon will insert some packing into the remaining cavity to minimize any bleeding and keep it open for 24­ 48 hours. As the scar heals, the patient can expect to be out of the gym for weeks. If it is a deeper abscess, the surgeon  may  insert  a  drainage  tube.  Drainage  is maintained for several days to help prevent the abscess from reforming.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Microbiological  culture  of  biologic  samples  from  the wound is performed by the biopathologist and according to  the  antibiogram,  a  proper  medication  shall  be prescribed. In most cases, the physician supplies a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">combination of different antibiotics, including treatment of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. In those cases an anti­ staphylococcus antibiotic (flucioxacillin, dicloxacillin) or amoxicillin- clavulanic acid is given. Alternative antibiotics effective   against   community-acquired   methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), often include clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline and trimethoprim­ sulfamethoxazole,  while  combination  therapy  with antipseudomonal  antibiotics  (imipenem,  meropenem, aztreonam) is used to ensure treatment of resistant strains. Of course, we should not neglect the possible side effects of antibiotics, especially to the gastrointestinal system (diarrhea). The diarrhea occurs due to eradication of the normal gut flora by the antibiotic and results in an overgrowth of infectious bacteria. Therefore, the patient has to follow a diet rich in lactobacillus, found in organic yogurt, or kefir. In case there is a lactose intolerance, lactobacillus is also available in pharmaceutical made capsules.  Another  side  effect  symptom  involves inflammation of gingiva, giving an itching feeling in the oral cavity. Supplementation of B complex vitamins is also quite helpful.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Intramuscular abscess after it is surgically opened has to be cleaned up twice on a daily basis, as long as the patient follows an antibiotic medication.White blood cells (WBCs) count, erythrocyte  sedimentation rate  (ESR) and C- reactive protein (CRP) are laboratory evaluations that should be considered on a weekly basis.This follow up will provide details concerning the progress of inflammation. Fever is also a good sign of inflammatory response. Creatinokinase enzyme (CPK) is a biochemical marker that is also elevated, as a result of the repeated intramuscular injections;  named  as  rhabdomyolysis  effect.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is another biochemical evaluation, raised in tissue inflammation and cellular damage. When the abscess heals, scar tissue will form, therefore, no more injections in that area.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Sometimes, when the abscess is localized into the gluteal area, the athlete is unable to perform a hip flexion. This particular  movement  happens  during  the  negative­ eccentric phase of the leg press for example, or the squat. The reason is because of the extensive intramuscular abscess that forces press against the sciatic nerve.The hip flexion  stretches  the  sciatic  nerve,  giving  a  painful sensation. As well know from human anatomy, the particular nerve is the largest in the peripheral nervous system. When sciatic nerve undergoes irritation, pain reflects on the head of the fibula; the bone located on the outer area of tibia. As the sciatic nerve proceeds down to the posterior femoral region, it splits into the posterior tibial nerve and the peroneal nerve.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Rarely, poor septic conditions (needle sharing, reusing</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">needles and syringes) are responsible for the entrance of microbes into the muscle. Pure ethanol 95% must be used for sterilization of the skin (epidermis), both before and after the injection. Of course we have to change the needles and better to use another syringe, in case we shoot on different areas on the same day. Subcutaneous injections are rarely to develop any kind of infection, since the adipose tissue has lesser amount of vessels and contamination  spreads  slower.  Peptides  are  usually injected into the fat, as somatropin (human growth hormone-  hGH),  insulin  and  human  chorionic gonadotropin.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Personally,  I  have  once  experienced  a  localized inflammation, dealing with a subcutaneous injection of hGH. It was something inevitable, since I had not followed strictly the sterilization circumstances and wrongly used the  same  needle  twice.  According  to  my  personal experience,  as  a  former  steroid  abuser  during  my bodybuilding  competitive  career,  I  faced  two intramuscular abscesses, that both had to be surgically opened, while I was following an effective combination of antibiotics. For the first time, I decided to switch from the pharmaceutical  brand  (Winstrol  Depot-Desma)  of stanozolol, manufactured in Spain. Instead, I wrongly chose to use an underground product.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark263">After a couple of weeks, both my deltoid and gluteus were infected, giving a feeling of discomfort and nausea. At first, I tried to self-care at home, by applying the initial steps of abscess treatment; but there was no progress. I was lucky that it was during my residency practice at the hospital, so my colleagues treated me successfully. General surgeons cooperation, along with biopathologists, helped me to heal within four weeks. As I was told later, the steroid abuse cost me in terms of blood coagulation, so my bleeding time was prolonged (INR&gt;1.3). In such cases, vitamin K and plasma factors are administrated IV. Two years later, during my final competition at the masters nationals, there was a visible scar on my buttocks, although i was pretty well tanned and colored by spray.</a></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How to Avoid Abscess</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Intramuscular abscess is something that can be avoided. Sadly, sometimes the repeated steroid abuse is inevitable and steroid solution is not able to get absorbed from system. Proper procedures should be followed and safety should be maintained. Rotation of injection sites and areas, along with extra cautious sterilization, will diminish possibilities. When injecting into the buttock muscle you must be particularly careful the needle does not touch the sciatic nerve. Injecting the nerve causes severe radiating pain to the lower limbs (similar to an electric shock) and can damage the nerve permanently. In a worst case</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">scenario, sciatic nerve damage can lead to lower limb paralysis.The proper spot is the upper outer gluteal area. Sciatic&#39;s nerve origin is located towards the inner side of gluteus maximus. When injecting, ensure that no blood vessels are touched. If blood is visible in the syringe when pulling  the  syringe  plunger  back  towards  you, immediately  remove  the  needle  and  press  on  the injection site to stop the bleeding. A broken blood vessel causes internal bleeding within the muscle. You may feel pain and stiffness in the muscle. When a blood vessel breaks, scar tissue or blood clots can form and if a blood clot starts to wander and reaches the heart or lungs, the consequences  can  be  life-threatening,  known  as pulmonary embolism. Injections that hit an artery can be particularly dangerous.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Most bodybuilders do not have the means or education necessary to recognize counterfeits or have all of their drugs tested in a laboratory for purity. It is also doubtful whether counterfeit black market products are subject to the appropriate sterilization processes. As a result, people are gambling with their health by using steroids they procure  from  black  market  sources.  Sometimes  the product is fairly pure and the user experiences the expected results. ROIDTEST™ is a brilliant new project by William Llewellyn, able to spot the fake underground, or counterfeit products. Injecting drugs carries a number of potential risks. Intramuscular abscesses are secondary complications and should therefore be preventable.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="661" height="645" alt="image" src="img/Image_091.gif"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark264">References: Intramuscular Abscess</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;"><i>Counterfeiting in performance- and image-enhancing drugs, </i>Graham MR, Ryan P, Baker JS, Davies B, Thomas <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">NE, </span>Cooper SM, Evans P, Easmon <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">S, </span>Walker CJ, Cowan D, Kiernan AT.

The technology utilizes a series of reactive chemicals  called  reagents,  which  help  confirm  the presence of specific substances by color reaction. This type of testing has been widely used in law enforcement and customs interdiction for decades because it offers almost immediate visual confirmation. It can be used essentially  anywhere  to  check  for  the  presence  of contraband.This technology has recently been adapted to anabolic steroid substances. In fact, <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>have cofounded a company called Colorimetries, which has helped advance it to a point where it is a very effective for counterfeit detection.  We  market  it  under  the  brand  name ROIDTEST™. It is already distributed in seven countries, and I am proud to say is making a difference.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark266">How ROIDTEST™ Works</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As a colorimetric test, ROIDTEST relies upon basic chemistry to determine if a particular steroid is inside a sample. These tests are based on a strong acid, typically something like sulfuric acid. The acid breaks down the steroid, and catalyzes a reaction between its fragment(s) and certain additional component(s) in the solution. The result is a color change. In order to minimize false positives, we&#39;ve worked with our partner forensics lab on extensive testing and retesting of the reagents against potential contaminants, carriers, and substitutes.Through this work, we&#39;ve been able to develop a reliable system for identifying more than 20 different anabolic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The ROIDTEST reagents all come in clear ampules with a small level of fluid inside. To test a steroid, just break open the ampule and insert a small sample. These tests are highly sensitive, so it requires only a small amount. For injectables, just a few drops of oil and for pills, a match­ head size of powder from the tablet or capsule is needed. The system can also test raw powders, as well as water­ based steroids with special sample handling. After a few moments of mixing, a color reaction should be observed. Two different Substance Test ampules are typically used to test each drug.This provides a more reliable and distinct 2-part colorimetric fingerprint. Detailed photographs of the testing steps are included at the end of the photo library. <span class="s5">Detailed photographs of the testing steps are included at the end of the photo library.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark267">Strengths and Limitations</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Colorimetric testing for anabolic/androgenic steroids has</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">progressed to a point we can do the following with high confidence.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">1.    Confirm presence of labeled steroid. It is unlikely that other substances will produce the same set of color reactions to these reagents as the tested steroid. A matching set of reactions presumptively confirms the steroid is present in the sample.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">2.

If the expected color reaction is not noticed, it is reasonable to conclude that the labeled steroid is not present in a sample.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">3.    Exclude presence of any common steroid. Given the high sensitivity of colorimetric testing, if no color reaction is noticed from the recommended set of tests, it is also reasonable to conclude that none of the 20+ tested common steroids is present in the sample.These all react in varying ways to the reagent sets.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">4.    Identify substituted steroid. If a different set of color reactions is noticed than expected, the fingerprint may be consistent with another anabolic steroid. These reactions  can  be  cross-referenced,  and  presumptive identification of another steroid made. For example, it is easy to tell when methandrostenolone has been put into oxandrolone tablets. The reactions are quite distinct for each, and would never be confused.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;">There are also some limitations to Colorimetric Testing. They are summarized as follows.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">1.    Results are not conclusive. Even though these tests  are  quite  reliable,  we don&#39;t  consider them a substitute for laboratory analysis.This would be needed to make a true assessment of a substance&#39;s chemical makeup. It is always possible some other, unknown steroid, drug, or other substance is present. Likewise, legal determinations (such as arrest or prosecution) should never be based on presumptive testing.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">2.    Qualitative, not Quantitative. Colorimetric testing can tell you with high confidence if a particular steroid is present (referred to as qualitative testing), but not how much is in the sample (quantitative). If you want to know how much is in a product, you need to send it to a lab for thorough analysis.While a limitation, it is also important to note that drug substitution appears to be more common than blatant underdosing.This is because consumers tend to  notice  underdosing  more  easily.  Their  cycle  is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">ineffective in this case. It is much harder to determine the difference between nandrolone and methenolone, or stanozolol and oxandrolone, for example.This often goes unnoticed without some type of testing.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">3.    Doesn&#39;t test Safety. Colorimetric testing can’t tell you if there are bacteria in your sample, or make any other evaluation of the safety of a product.These tests are very helpful when it comes to checking a basic steroid, but nothing replaces full lab analysis if you want to examine everything that could be in a sample.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark268">When To Test</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, this is the new reality if you live and train in most Western countries. The vast majority of anabolic steroids sold on the black market these days are made in underground labs. Many lab operators work diligently and careful to produce safe and effective products. However, at the same time there is tremendous financial incentive to cut corners. This includes both the lab operators, and the underground companies that supply them with raw materials. It is very common for cheap drugs to be substituted for more expensive ones along the way. If you plan to use black market products, it is a good idea to regularly check the reliability of your sources to help assure that you are getting what you pay for.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">One of the best ways to check a source is to test something expensive. Oxandrolone is a very good choice.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is almost universally available, expensive, and produces a distinct colorimetric fingerprint that you really can&#39;t confuse for anything else.Trenbolone is another excellent choice, expensive and found everywhere these days. It is really quick to check too. Trenbolone produces an immediate deep purple color reaction to ROIDTEST™ Substance Test D. You&#39;re not going to confuse it with other AAS. Below are common steroid raw material costs, as taken from an underground supplier&#39;s price list. This should help you find some other steroids to test the next time you are shopping.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark269">Summary</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Nothing is certain in today&#39;s market. Pharmaceutical diversion from legitimate suppliers is costly, unreliable, and uncommon. As such, underground manufacturing dominates the supply chain. Presumptive colorimetric testing can be an effective way to help check your products for legitimacy, and keep ongoing tabs on your suppliers.The money you&#39;d spend on a couple of test kits here and there can save you quite a lot more in the form of bad purchases. Just keep in mind what it can and cannot do. A pass is not a guarantee you have sterile or safe product. But it is a good way to see if you are really buying X, Y, or Z steroid. After all, if there are issues at the most fundamental level of product assembly (putting the right steroid in the bottle), then it is fair to expect quality control issues elsewhere.</p><p

Chorionic gonadotropin is a polypeptide hormone normally found in the female body during the early months of pregnancy. It is synthesized in syncytiotrophoblast  cells  of  the  placenta,  and  is responsible for increasing the production of progesterone, a pregnancy-sustaining hormone.Chorionic gonadotropin is present in significant amounts only during pregnancy, and is used as an indicator of pregnancy by standard over- the-counter pregnancy test kits. Blood levels of chorionic gonadotropin become noticeable as early as seven days after ovulation, and rise evenly to a peak at approximately two to three months into gestation. After this point, the hormone level will drop gradually until the point of birth.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2070">Although it possesses minor FSH-like (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) activity, the physiological actions of chorionic gonadotropin mainly mimic those of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH). As a clinical drug, hCG is used as an exogenous form of LH. It is typically applied to support ovulation and pregnancy in women, most specifically those suffering from infertility due to low concentrations of gonadotropins and an inability to ovulate. Due to the ability of LH to stimulate the Leydig&#39;s cells in the testes to manufacture testosterone, hCG is also used with men to treat  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism,  a  disorder characterized by low testosterone levels and insufficient LH output. The drug is also used in the treatment of prepubertal cryptochidism, a condition in which one or both of the testicles have failed to descend into the scrotum. HCG is used by male athletes for its ability to increase endogenous testosterone production, generally during, or at the conclusion of, a steroid cycle, when natural hormone production has been interrupted.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Chorionic gonadotropin was first discovered in 1920,<span class="s33">1 </span>and was identified as a pregnancy hormone approximately 8 years later.<span class="s33">2 </span>The first drug preparation containing chorionic gonadotropin came in the form of an animal pituitary extract, which was developed as a commercial product by Organon. Organon introduced the extract in 1931, under the trade name Pregnon. A trademark dispute forced the company to change the name Pregnyl, however, which reached market in 1932. Pregnyl is still sold by Organon to this day, although it no longer comes in the form of a pituitary  extract.  Manufacturing  techniques  were introduced in 1940 that allowed the hormone to be</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">obtained by filtering and purifying the urine of pregnant women, and by the late 1960&#39;s were adopted by all manufacturers formerly using animal extracts. Over the years the process and manufacturing protocols have been refined, but hCG is made in essentially the same way today as it was decades ago. While modern preparations are of biological origin, the risks of biological contaminants are said to be low (although cannot be completely excluded).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Early on, the indicated uses for chorionic gonadotropin preparations were much broader than they are presently. Product literature from the 1950&#39;s and &#39;60&#39;s recommended the use of these drugs for, among other things, the treatment of uterine bleeding and amenorrhea, Froehlich&#39;s syndrome,  cryptochidism,  female  sterility,  obesity, depression, and male impotence. A good example of the wide uses of chorionic gonadotropin are illustrated in the preparation Glukor, which was described in 1958 as being, &quot;Three times more effective than testosterone. For tired young men in male climacteric. For tired old men in male senility. Beneficial in impotence,angina and coronary heart disease, neuropsychosis, prostatitis, [and] myocarditis.&quot; Such recommendations, however, reflect an era less tightly regulated by government agency and less reliant on proven clinical trials. Today, FDA-approved indications for hCG are limited to the treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and cryptocridism in men,and anovulatory infertility in women.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">HCG has no significant thyroid-stimulating activity. This is specifically pointed out because hCG was once widely used for the treatment of obesity. The trend seemed to have become popular in 1954, after a paper was published by  Dr.  A.T.W.  Simeons  claiming  that  chorionic gonadotropin  was  an  effective  adjunct  to  dieting. According to the study, patients were able to effectively stave off hunger with severely low-calorie diets provided they took the hormone injections. Dubbed the Simeons diet, people all across the country were soon subjecting themselves to severe calorie restriction (500 calories per day) and taking hCG injections. Soon after, the hormone itself became the main focus for fat loss. In fact, by 1957 it was said that hCG was the most commonly prescribed medication  for  weight  loss.  More  recent  and comprehensive investigations, however, refute that there is any anorexic or metabolic advantage to the use of hCG.<span class="s33">3 </span>In 1962, the Journal of the American Medical Association had already been warning consumers about the hCG-inclusive Simeons diet, stating the more basic fact that severe calorie restriction, which causes the body to sacrifice muscle and organ  tissue  to  obtain  necessary  protein,  was  more</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">hazardous than obesity itself. By 1974, the FDA had had enough of the hCG fat loss claims, and mandated the following statement to be included with all prescribing literature. &quot;HCG HAS NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">OBESITY.

In spite of this warning and evidence to the contrary, some clinics still promote the use of hCG for dieting purposes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2071">Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is a widely popular drug preparation today, owing to the fact that it remains an indispensable part of ovulation therapy for many cases of female  infertility.  Popular  preparations  in  the  U.S. presently include Pregnyl (Organon), Profasi (Serono), and Novarel (Ferring), although many other trade names have been popular for chorionic gonadotropin preparations over the years.This drug is also sold widely outside of the United States, and can be found under many additional trade names, too numerous to list here. Owing to the fact that this drug is not controlled on a federal level, U.S. athletes and bodybuilders unable to find a local physician willing to prescribe the drug to treat steroid-induced hypogonadism  often  order  the  product  from international pharmacy sources. Given that this drug is cheap  and  rarely  counterfeited,  most  international sources  are  trusted.  Although  recombinant  forms  of chorionic gonadotropin have been introduced to market in recent years, the vast supply and low cost of biological hCG continues to make it a staple product for both labeled and off-label uses.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2072">Chorionic   gonadotropin   is   an   oligosaccharide glycoprotein composed of 244 amino acids. It has an alpha subunit that is 92 amino acids long and identical to that  of  luteinizing  hormone  (LH),  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It has a beta subunit that is unique to hCG.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is widely available in various human and veterinary drug markets. Composition and dosage may vary by country and manufacturer, but typically contain 1,000, 1,500, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 international units (IU) per dose. All forms are supplied as a lyophilized powder, requiring reconstitution with sterile diluent (water) before use.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2074">Administration (Men):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used to treat hypogonadotropin hypogonadism, current  FDA-approved  protocols  recommend  either a short 6-week program, or a long-term program lasting up to 1 year, depending on the individual needs of the patient.  Prescribing  guidelines  for  short-term  use recommend that 500 to 1,000 units to be given 3 times a week for 3 weeks, followed by the same dose twice a week for 3 weeks. The long-term recommendations call for 4,000 units to be administered 3 times weekly for 6 to 9 months, after which point the dosage is reduced to 2,000 units  3  times  weekly  for  an  additional  3  months. Bodybuilders and athletes use hCG either on cycle, in an effort  to  maintain  testicular  integrity  during  steroid administration, or after a cycle, to help restore hormonal homeostasis more quickly. Both types of use are deemed effective when properly applied.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Post-Cycle:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Human Chorionic gonadotropin is often used with other medications as part of an in-depth Post Cycle Therapy (PCT)  program  focused  on  restoring  endogenous testosterone production more rapidly at the end of a steroid  cycle.  Restoring  endogenous  testosterone production is a special concern at the conclusion of each cycle, a time when subnormal androgen levels (due to steroid induced suppression) could be very costly to the physique.The main concern is the action of cortisol, which in many ways is balanced out by the effect of androgens. Cortisol sends the opposite message to the muscles than testosterone, or to breakdown protein in the cell. Left unchecked by a low level of testosterone, cortisol can quickly strip much of your new muscle mass away. Protocols for the post-cycle use of hCG generally call for the administration of 2000-3000 Units every 2nd or 3rd day, taken for no longer than 2 or 3 weeks. If used for too long or at too high a dose, the drug may actually function to desensitize the Leydig&#39;s cells to luteinizing hormone, further hindering a return to homeostasis. For a more comprehensive view of hCG&#39;s role in a proper hormonal- recovery program, please refer to the Post Cycle Therapy section of this book.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On-Cycle:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bodybuilders and athletes may also administer Human Chorionic Gonadotropin throughout a steroid cycle, in an effort  to  avoid  testicular  atrophy  and  the  resulting reduced ability to respond to LH stimulus. In effect, this practice is used to avoid the problem of testicular atrophy, instead of trying to correct it later on when the cycle is over. It is important to remember that the dosage needs to be carefully monitored with this type of use, as high levels of hCG may cause increased testicular aromatase expression (raising estrogen levels),<span class="s33">5 </span>and also desensitize the testes to LH.<span class="s33">6 </span>As such, the drug may actually induce primary   hypogonadism   when   misused,   greatly prolonging, not improving, the recovery window. Current protocols for the use of hCG in this manner involve administering 250 IU subcutaneously every 3rd or 4th day throughout the length of the steroid cycle. Higher doses may be necessary for some individuals, but st no point should exceed 500 IU per injection.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">These on-cycle hCG protocols were developed by Dr. John Crisler,  a  well-known  figure  in  the  anti-aging  and hormone-replacement field, for use with his testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) patients. Although TRT is often administered on a long-term basis, testicular atrophy is a common cosmetic complaint of patients irrespective of the maintenance of normal androgen levels. Dr. Crisler&#39;s hCG program is designed to alleviate this concern in a manner that is acceptable for longer-term use. For those interested in precisely timing their hCG shots in relation to a  prescribed  testosterone  replacement  program,  Dr. Crisler recommends the following in his paper,&quot;An Update to the Crisler hCG Protocol,&quot;&quot;...my test cyp TRT patients now take their hCG at 250IU two days before, as well as the day immediately previous to, their IM shot. All administer their hCG subcutaneously, and dosage may be adjusted as necessary (1 have yet to see more than 350IU per dose required)... Those TRT patients who prefer a transdermal testosterone, or even testosterone pellets (although I am not in favor of same), take their hCG every third day.&quot;</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2075">Administration (Women):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When  used  to  induce  ovulation  and  pregnancy  in anovulatory infertile woman, a dose of 5,000 to 10,000 units is administered one day following the last dose of menotropins.The timing is specific so that the hormone is given precisely at the right moment in the ovulation cycle.

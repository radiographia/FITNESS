It is also one of the most important dietary components in the muscle-building process.This fatty acid is found in animal products, and is especially rich in meats such as beef, chicken, salmon, duck, and lamb.<span class="s50">1 </span>ARA serves as a precursor to several hormone-like compounds in the body, notably prostaglandins, leukotrienes, lipoxins, and thromboxanes.<span class="s50">2 </span>Because of this, it is integral to a series of biological  functions  including  nutrient  metabolism, neurological  activity,  immunity,  inflammation,  insulin sensitivity,  bone  mineral  density,  and  vascular homeostasis.<span class="s50">3 4 5 </span>It is also necessary for the adaptive (growth) response to training.<span class="s50">6 7 </span>In sports nutrition, ARA is widely supplemented (as X-FACTOR™) to increase muscle size, strength, and power, especially at times of training stagnation.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1525">The role arachidonic acid plays in the process of muscle growth appears to be largely mediated by its conversion to prostaglandins. These are locally acting hormones, which can shift cell physiology to favor repair and growth. The main focus here is PGF2alpha, which is a known regulator of muscle protein synthesis.</a><span class="s50">8 </span>Among other things, it may enhance muscle cell sensitivity to anabolic hormones like IGF-1,<span class="s50">9  </span>testosterone,<span class="s50">10  </span>and insulin.<span class="s50">11  </span>PGF2alpha  also appears to support the satellite cell cycle, particularly satellite cell proliferation and nuclear accretion.<span class="s50">1213 </span>This is very important to continued muscle hypertrophy. Muscle cells grow very large next to other cells in the body. This necessitates they contain many nuclei, not just one. These regulate a myriad of cell activities. However, these cells cannot grow past a certain point unless more nuclei are added.  Intracellular  metabolism  becomes  inefficient otherwise. Therefore, by increasing the number of nuclei within these cells, arachidonic acid may support increases in the overall capacity of these cells to grow.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clinical Studies:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">A study published in the Public Library of Science journal PLOSONE in 2016 examined the effects of 8 weeks of X- FACTOR™  supplementation  with  a  group  of  30 experienced weightlifters.<span class="s50">14 </span>This placebo-controlled study was immediately quite unique, because it examined the men in a state of training stagnation (plateau, common in experienced lifters). A dose of 1,500 mg of arachidonic acid was taken each day, and the study period progressed for 8 weeks. The men also followed a controlled resistance training program. At the end of the study, only the men taking arachidonic acid noticed significant increases in</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">lean body mass, muscle strength, and power.Those taking placebo remained stuck in a training plateau. The science magazine Examine.com summarized the results of this study, including the following:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">&quot;Lean body mass significantly increased in the ARA group only (+1.6 kilograms; 3%), with almost no change in the placebo group. Similarly, while both groups significantly increased muscle thickness compared to baseline, the increase was marginally greater in the ARA group (8% vs. 4% increase; p=0.08). Neither group showed a significant change or difference from one another in fat mass. Leg press 1RM was significantly increased in both groups without significant difference between them. In contrast, bench press 1RM (+8.7%), Wingate peak power (+12.7%), and average peak power (+13.2%) significantly increased in the ARA group only, leading to a significant difference in performance  compared  to  the  placebo  group,  which experienced no significant changes.When bench press and leg press IRMs were combined to represent total-body strength,  only  the  ARA  group  showed  a  significant increase.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="252" height="137" alt="image" src="img/Image_434.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">Lean Body Mass increased by 3.57 lbs. in the men supplementing arachidonic acid (X-Factor).That was roughly 1<i>12 </i>lb. of muscle each week of the study.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="253" height="138" alt="image" src="img/Image_435.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: center;">Bench Press 1 -Rep Max improved by 21 lbs. with arachidonic acid.

Here, 31 trained men were each given 1,000 mg of ARA per day (or placebo) during a 50-day resistance-training program. Again, there was a clear effect of supplementation. At the end of this investigation, only those subjects taking ARA noticed a significant increase <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">in </span>muscle Peak Power (+8.5%).There were also statistical trends of improvement in Bench Press 1-rep max <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(+25 lbs.) </span>and Total Work capacity in the supplemented group.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Pharmacology:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Arachidonic acid is richly stored in your muscles. It gets released when the fibers are damaged by training or other stress, which triggers a local reaction. This response supports inflammation and repair (anabolism), as well as delayed onset muscle soreness. ARA explains why pain relievers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can sometimes blunt muscle growth, and reminds us that the old adage &quot;no pain, no gain&quot; is a fundamentally true one. Arachidonic acid liberation from damaged muscle fibers is, similarly, the first anabolic trigger in a long but highly localized cascade that will control the rebuilding and strengthening of muscle tissue after exercise.<span class="s33">16 </span><span class="s50">17 18 </span>As a crude explanation, arachidonic acid helps direct the body to where it needs muscle tissue repair, by facilitating the localized actions of certain anabolic hormones.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  level  of  arachidonic  acid  stored  in  muscle phospholipids is directly tied to the anabolic productivity of our workouts. It partly dictates how much will be liberated by training, as does training intensity. Further, muscle levels of ARA levels fluctuate. Regular exercise has been  shown  to  significantly  lower  the  content  of arachidonic  acid  in  many  cases.<span class="s33">19  </span><span class="s50">20  21  </span>Since prostaglandin synthesis is tied to the amount of available</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">arachidonic acid, lower levels result in less arachidonic acid being released during exercise.This results in a lower concentration of prostaglandins being formed, and thus a less intense anabolic response. In such a state, you will need to workout more vigorously to receive the same level of ARA release and anabolic stimulation.This makes ARA depletion a key concern when a plateau arises.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1527">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Arachidonic acid is available in 250 mg softgels under the brand name X-FACTOR™ by Molecular Nutrition. ARA <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is </span>a patented (#6,841,573) sports nutrition ingredient, and carries the ingredient trade name ARASYN™.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1528">Administration;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1529">As a short-term anabolic agent, arachidonic acid is generally supplemented </a><span style=" color: #393939;">at </span>a dose of 500-1,500 mg per day. This is taken for a period of 7-8 weeks, with the full dose taken about one hour before training (on lifting days). It is recommended to follow this program 1 to 2 times per year, when training has become stagnated. Arachidonic acid is often taken in lower supplemental doses <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">(250 </span>mg every 1-2 days) as well, particularly when training intensity is high, or the diet is low in animal products.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Safety:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In clinical studies involving the supplementation of up to 1,700 mg of arachidonic acid per day for extended periods, general markers of health were unaffected. This includes no notable change in HDL, LDL, or total cholesterol values, immune system response functioning, or platelet aggregation values.<span class="s33">22 </span><span class="s50">23 24 </span>Furthermore, the investigation  at Baylor University noted a significant reduction in IL-6 in the X-FACTOR supplemented group. This is a principle inflammatory cytokine, and a stimulus for the production of C-reactive protein. High levels of IL-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">6 are correlated with systemic inflammation, poor health, and mortality. The results suggest that when combined with  resistance  training,  ARA  supplementation  may actually produce a reduction in systemic inflammation. More research is needed to confirm this potential benefit.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">On a more general note, the American Heart Association announced its position on omega-6 EFA consumption in 20 0 9 <span class="s50">25 </span>In reviewing some of the more current data, they found that diets low in omega-6 fats were associated with an increased risk of heart disease compared to diets with higher intakes.The paper also discusses arachidonic acid, and  how  this  essential  fat  is  normally  not  pro- inflammatory, nor outwardly unhealthy to consume. The American Heart Association now recommends that 5-10% of your calories each day come from Omega-6 fats, including ARA. Diets rich in Omega-3&#39;s are also believed to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">be very healthy, but this should not come at the exclusion <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">of omega-6&#39;s.</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1530">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1531">Arachidonic  acid  (X-Factor)  often  produces  an amplification of residual post-workout muscle soreness. This  </a><span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is  </span>due  to  an  intensification  of  the  normal physiological  response  to  training,  and  represents increased intensity of the anabolic cascade. Those with existing minor muscle, connective tissue, or joint injuries may notice more pain during supplementation. In such case, one may wish to avoid supplementation until the injury is healed. Arachidonic acid may also produce a greater incidence of headaches in a small percentage of users, which may be due to its effect as a vasodilator. Increasing daily water consumption often alleviates this side effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Contraindications:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Those with an existing medical condition related to inflammation may find that the added arachidonic acid exacerbates symptoms of their disorder, and should avoid supplementation.

As a research compound, it has been shown to heal numerous body tissues including the skin, muscle, and bone, as well as ligament and tendon. Its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. However, it does appear  to  increase  the  density  of  growth  hormone receptors in some tissues.<span class="s33">1</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bodybuilders and other athletes use BPC-157 to speed repair  of  damaged  muscle  and  joint  tissue.  Some underground experts have touted it as &#39;the most powerful healing drug on earth for injuries&#39;, after experiencing that administration of this compound let injuries, which usually take 10-12 weeks to heal, healed within 2-3 weeks. Anecdotes  suggest  that  BPC-157  is  effective  when administered immediately after an injury occurs, but also when taken in order to fix an improperly healed injury that occurred years ago. Although athletes inject this peptide, BPC-157 is stable in gastric juice<span class="s33">2 </span>and therefore orally available.  Animal  studies  have  proven  topical administration of BPC-157 to be effective as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">In dozens of animal studies, BPC-157 has been shown to stimulate repair processes of the mucosa.

Most of the research into BPC-157 is</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">done by Sikiric, and has been sponsored by the Croatian pharmaceutical  company  Pliva.  Financial  difficulties prompted Pliva in 2005 to halt the investments in BPC-157. Attempts of Merck, which had been a business partner of Pliva for years, to buy the BPC-157 patents and research, have failed. Even though its future as a drug remain unclear, a few years later web shops specializing in research chemicals began selling it.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1534">How supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1535">BPC-157 is not available as a pharmaceutical product at this time.

This receptor plays an important role in human metabolism, as it is involved in the regulation of genes that help manage the transport and oxidation of fatty acids. PPARD agonists are of great interest in medical research at present, as they hold the potential to influence areas such as insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and lipid balance. Further, they may offer therapeutic benefit with conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol.Cardarine is a research drug, once under development for improving HDL cholesterol in patients with dyslipidemia.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">As a PPARD agonist, cardarine has several effects that are of interest in the sports and fitness community. First, its use may cause a shift in energy metabolism, reducing glucose utilization  and  increasing  the  capacity  for  fatty  acid oxidation.<span class="s33">1 </span>It can also favor glycogen storage in <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">muscle </span>tissue,  improve  ATP  energy  efficiency,  and  enhance exercise  endurance.<span class="s33">2  </span><span class="s50">3  </span>In  early  animal  studies,  it dramatically increased the running capacity of mice.<span class="s33">4 </span>This drastic shift in the utilization of fat for energy may further improve body composition. To that effect, cardarine has been associated with a significant reduction in body fat in both animal studies and human anecdotal reports.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps most interesting, PPARD activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis in the muscles. This can actually remodel the muscle tissue. In studies using both trained and untrained mice, cardarine caused fast twitch muscle fibers to convert to slow twitch fibers.The latter use oxygen for ATP energy, and are less susceptible to fatigue. Slow twitch fibers <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">are </span>also expressed more abundantly in endurance vs. strength athletes. Again, this effect can substantially improve exercise endurance. Cardarine is often called an exercise mimetic, because it can produce these changes in metabolism and fiber composition, which we normally associate with endurance training.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cardarine successfully completed preliminary Phase <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">I </span>human safety studies,<span class="s33">5 </span>and then Phase <span style=" color: #393939;">II </span>clinical trials.<span class="s33">6</span>The Phase II study examined the effects of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg daily for 12 weeks in 268 patients with low HDL levels.

This increased HDL (good) cholesterol by approximately <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">17%, </span>and reduced LDL and triglycerides by <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">7% </span>and 1<span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">7%, </span>respectively.

This drug came about as part of an agreement the company signed with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 1992, which focused on developing drugs jointly for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.<span class="s33">9 </span>As subject to this agreement, GSK would obtain worldwide exclusive rights to cardarine. GSK would fund further development, and  Ligand  would  receive  substantial  royalties  and milestone payments as the drug progressed through investigatory stages.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The first appearance of cardarine in the medical literature came in 2001, when its effect on reverse cholesterol transport was investigated.<span class="s33">10  </span>For several years, there appeared to be a flurry of research activity around this agent. The drug appeared in numerous animal studies, and then entered Phase <span style=" color: #393939;">I </span>human trials. Ligand announced the receipt of a $1 million milestone payment in 2004, when GSK then announced the decision to progress to Phase II trials. The drug seemed to be on a strong development track. However, it was discontinued in 2009, when long-term animal studies revealed a carcinogenic effect (see: Description).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 2013, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) issued a press release warning the public about the &quot;serious toxicities&quot; that were discovered during pre-clinical testing of cardarine.<span class="s33">11 </span>This statement came as a result of an emerging cooperation between GSK and WADA, which involved the sharing of information. GSK had apparently learned of the black market availability of cardarine. WADA learned of the drug&#39;s potential carcinogenicity.

It contains a   mixture   of   heptaminol,   AMP   (adenosine monophosphate),  vitamin  B-12,  sodium  selenite, magnesium aspartate, and potassium aspartate.This blend makes for a restorative &quot;tonic&quot; type drug, administered to protect an animal&#39;s muscle mass and overall wellness after illness, injury, or trauma.lt is most often used on horses, and is typically applied as an anti-catabolic after strenuous activity, or to help get an animal back on its feet after a debilitating infection/illness. At other times it is simply used to support the vitality of an animal that is otherwise healthy, but at the moment less than vigorous in its daily activities. In some cases it is even used for the very basic purpose of remedying a deficiency in vitamin B-12 or selenium intake. Bodybuilders are attracted to Kynoselen for its mild anabolic and lipolytic properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1556">The principle active ingredient in Kynoselen is heptaminol, which is classified as an amino alcohol with myocardial stimulant and vasodilatory properties. It is also identified as an  inotropic  compound,  which  increases  contractile strength, and minimizes fatigue, of skeletal muscles.</a><span class="s33">1 </span>It has demonstrated  a  specific  ability  to  increase  the differentiation of satellite muscle cells,<span class="s33">2 </span>a process that helps  generate  new  muscle  tissue  (skeletal  muscle growth). This same ingredient is also known to affect the release  and  uptake  of  norepinephrine  (noradrenalin), increasing levels of this hormone/neurotransmitter in the blood.<span class="s33">3 </span>Since noradrenalin is an important regulator of lipolysis in humans, this allows heptaminol to impart some fat-loss effect. Adenosine triphosphate is also regarded as a key component of the product, and plays a role in the storage and release of energy. Overall, both the anabolic and lipolytic properties of Kynoselen are measurable when used in humans, but not dramatic. It is capable of imparting some increases in strength, muscle mass, and fat loss, but the results will not rival those of anabolic steroids. Still, being that this drug is legal in most jurisdictions, it remains an attractive alternative to anabolic steroids for many individuals.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Heptaminol, the principle active ingredient in Kynoselen, was first heavily investigated in clinical medicine during the early 1950s. It was soon developed into a prescription drug, and has since been sold by a series of drug manufacturers  in  many  different  parts  of  the  world. Currently its most common therapeutic use is to treat orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">pressure upon standing. Various preparations containing heptaminol have been produced over the years, the most notable of which have included Amtdrina (Italy), Cortensor (Belgium and Switzerland), Hept-A-Myl (USA), Heptamyl (Belgium  and  Switzerland),  and  Heptylon  (France). Although  a  variety  of  human  medications  containing heptaminol have been in commerce for decades, these preparations were rarely of interest to athletes.Years later, under a far different medical setting, Western athletes were first introduced to the drug.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The French veterinary preparation Kynoselen would be the first  heptaminol-containing  drug  to  grab  large-scale international  attention,  becoming  popular  among American bodybuilders and athletes during the latter part of the 1990s. This was some years subsequent to laws being passed that had increased the penalties for dealing in anabolic steroids. During this time, availability of the drugs had shifted, and for some buyers scarce supply and high legal risk made the drugs less attractive. Many athletes were becoming increasingly resourceful in finding other non-scheduled performance-enhancing drugs that could be purchased and used with less legal risk.Kynoselen was already known to athletes in Europe, and would quickly cross the Atlantic. By the year 2000, a number of exporters had set up operation to market the drug directly to  American  athletes.  Today,  Kynoselen  remains unscheduled and widely available in the United States and many areas abroad.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1557">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1558">Kynoselen is most commonly supplied in a 100 mL multi­ dose vial for injection. Active ingredients are heptaminol, disodic adenosine monophosphate, vitamin Bl2,selenium (sodium selenite), magnesium aspartate, and potassium aspartate.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1559">Heptaminol (supplied as heptaminol hydrochloride) is an amino alcohol with a structure of 6-amino-2-methyl- heptan-2-ol.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Kynoselen is not approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines  are  unavailable.  An  effective  dosage  for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes generally falls in the range of 1 mL weekly for every 25 pounds of bodyweight. This would mean that a 2001b bodybuilder would use around 8 mL per week. Due to high injection volume, some opt to take a lower dosage, injecting at the very least a 2 mL three times per week. At this dose, a single</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">100 mL vial would last about 16 weeks. At 8-10 mL per week a 100 mL bottle would last for 10 to 12 weeks. It is generally recommended to use the entire bottle once it has been opened, or discard any remaining drug that was not used during the cycle. As with all injectable drugs packaged in multi-dosed vials, contaminants will be introduced into the solution immediately once the seal is broken for the first injection.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1560">Because  it  tends  to  increase  noradrenalin  levels, Kynoselen is also a mild stimulant. It is likely for this specific reason that its use has been banned by certain horseracing organizations. This means that one can expect certain stimulant-related side effects, especially when taking this drug in higher dosages. This includes rapid heartbeat, sweating, jitters, restlessness, increased blood pressure, or insomnia. A good rule of thumb used by bodybuilders to try and keep such side effects from becoming a problem is to never inject more than 2 mL per day. They may also want to start with an amount lower than  the  recommended  dosage  (determined  by bodyweight), perhaps even half of this. The dose is then slowly increased, so that the peak level is reached only after three to four weeks of slow incremental increases.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Warnings:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1561">Individuals with high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease should not use Kynoselen.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Kynoselen usually sells for $75 to $100 per bottle at the retail level. It is not a controlled substance in the United States, and is likewise pretty easy to obtain locally or via mail order. Currently no significant fakes are known to exist. Given its abundance and low cost, counterfeits are not expected to be <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">a </span>significant problem anytime soon. It is also important to note that legitimate Kynoselen is a veterinary drug only, and has never been manufactured for human use.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s65">1 </span>Action of heptaminol hydrochloride on contractile properties in frog isolated twitch muscle fibre.

Prostaglandins are a series of natural oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acids, which have a variety of hormone-like actions in the body. Among  other  things,  PGF2alpha  is  involved  in vasoconstriction, increasing protein synthesis in skeletal muscle tissue, and reducing adipose tissue mass. This hormone-like chemical also stimulates smooth muscle contraction, and is involved in pain, inflammation, fever, ovulation, gastric motility, and fluid absorption in the gastrointestinal  tract.  In  veterinary  medicine  dinoprost tromethamine  is  most  commonly  used  in  estrus synchronization/fertility  timing,  for  treating  chronic endometriosis, and to induce abortion or labor. Dinoprost is not widely used in human medicine, but is sometimes applied to terminate pregnancy or induce labor.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Athletes  and  bodybuilders  are  attracted  to  dinoprost tromethamine for its strong thermogenic and muscle­ building properties. The anabolic effect of this drug has been substantiated by clinical studies, which have shown PGF2a to be a strong stimulator of protein synthesis, and key to both the immediate and long-term physiological adaptations to resistance training.<span class="s50">1 2 3 4  </span>Reports from athletes who have experimented with this agent generally support this compound being an excellent promoter of localized  muscle  growth,  usually  resulting  in  both increases in muscle size and definition. Dinoprost is also reported to be a very fast acting drug, with many claiming it has caused noticeable effect after being injected in a particular muscle group for only a couple of weeks. Clinical data also supports it being a substantially potent fat-loss drug,  with  PGF2a  shown  in  studies  to  inhibit  the stimulation of lipogenesis in fat cells.<span class="s50">5 </span>Again there is a great deal of anecdotal support for this property of dinoprost   tromethamine   among   athletes   and bodybuilders, with many claiming they notice a slight temperature elevation and marked fat loss during therapy.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1563">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dinoprost tromethamine was first introduced into clinical medicine in the early 1970s. The first approved use of the drug in human patients was to stimulate abortion during the second trimester. It has since remained of use for this purpose, but is most commonly associated these days with veterinary medicine. Here, it is widely applied to help farmers regulate the estrous cycle and fertility of various livestock.  Interest  in  dinoprost  tromethamine  as  an anabolic/thermogenic drug for athletes and bodybuilders did not appear until the late 1990s. This likely occurred</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="327" height="141" alt="image" src="img/Image_439.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">subsequent to the release of numerous medical studies linking PGF2alpha to muscle hypertrophy. Early theoretical concepts  stemming  from  this  research  evolved  into modern application protocols for the drug, which in spite of a high propensity <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>generate side effects, have proven to  be  highly  successful  for  many  athletes  and bodybuilders.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Over the years dinoprost tromethamine has appeared as a human medicine <span style=" color: #393939;">under </span>a wide number of trade names, including such popular drug products as Amoglandin (Sweden), Prostin (Sweden), Prostin F2 alpha (U.S., Australia, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom), Minprostin F2a (Germany), Enzaprost (Greece, Poland) and Prostarmon (Japan). Prostin F2 is no longer sold in the U.S., however, and there is presently no FDA approved replacement available for human use. Veterinary versions are more widely available and tend <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>provide significantly more active drug for less money than their human counterpart medicines, and as a result have been the  products  most  commonly  associated  with  the physique-  or  performance-enhancing  use  of  dinoprost tromethamine. Popular veterinary brands have included Lutalyse (Pharmacia Animal Health), Prostamate (Pfizer), Panacelan  (Daiichi  Pharmaceutical  Co.)  and  Dinolytic (Upjohn). Several corporate mergers have taken place in this  segment  of  the  market,  and  the  (now  larger) conglomerate Pharmacia has emerged as the worldwide leader in dinoprost sales.Lutalyse is consequently the most common form of dinoprost tromethamine of use among the athletic/bodybuilding community.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1564">How Supplied:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Dinoprost tromethamine is most commonly supplied in <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>multi-dose vial (5 mL-100 mL) in a dose of 5 mg per mL.

Asthmatic individuals may be particularly susceptible to these effects. Dinoprost may also cause gastrointestinal disturbances such as abdominal  cramping,  diarrhea,  vomiting  and  nausea. Other effects may include increased pulse rate, elevated blood pressure, chills, fever, and anorexia, and in women uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, and uterine or urinary infections. Pregnant women should not take or handle dinoprost. Reports of side effects among athletes using dinoprost for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes are common, and often extreme. This includes pronounced soreness at the site of injection; often beginning with a dull burning almost immediately after the shot is given. Chills and flu-like feelings are also commonly  reported  during  cycles,  as  are  bouts  of shortness  of  breath.  Injections  are  also  commonly followed by uncontrollable urges to urinate or defecate, including strong spasmodic contractions of the muscles involved in the control of these functions. Nausea and vomiting have also been commonly reported. </a><span style=" color: #393939;">For </span>many, the cramping, diarrhea, pain, and general feelings of upset stomach, malaise, and discomfort make dinoprost a drug they  experiment  with  only  briefly.  Others,  however, continue on with the drug, and often report that side effects become more tolerable over time.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As a human medication, dinoprost tromethamine is most commonly given intra-amniotically at a dose of 40 mg for the termination of pregnancy. It Is also sometimes given orally to pregnant women at a dose of 30-100 mg to induce labor, although this tends to produce more side effects than other, more recently adopted, medications. When  used  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes, dinoprost tromethamine is generally given by intramuscular injection.  Most noted for its ability to generate localized growth, common sites of injection include the shoulders, biceps, triceps, calves, chest, back, and legs.The user will typically inject in only one site per day at the start of therapy, but this may be increased to 2 or  more  injections  per  day  as  they  become  more accustomed to the drug and its side effects. Therapy begins slowly, and is initiated with a low starting dose of approximately  .5  milligram  per  injection.  If  the  first injection were given without significant side effects, the next injection would be increased to 1 milligram. This is slowly increased by .5-1 mg per application until a peak dose is reached. This might be a maximum of 5 mg per</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1568">injection site. Injection sites are also regularly rotated so that several days separate administration in the same muscle group. Note that for some, the pain after injection is so severe that training for that specific muscle group must be delayed for at least a few days. Individual sensitivity  to  the  drug  may,  therefore,  require modifications of their injection and training schedule to maximize results and comfort.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Dinoprost tromethamine is available in the U.S. and many other nations as a prescription drug product.

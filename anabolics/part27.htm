It specifically belongs to the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) family of drugs. These compounds all mimic the effects of endogenous GHRH, a 44-amino acid hypothalamic peptide hormone that stimulates the release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. CJC-1295 is actually a very long acting GHRH analog. Whereas native GHRH has a half-life measured in minutes, which reduces its practicality as a therapeutic agent, CJC-1295 is capable of sustained increases in growth hormone and IGF-1 with as little as once per week administration.This drug is used in the fitness community for the support of muscle growth and fat loss, as well as its potential anti-aging properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As mentioned, CJC-1295 is a slow acting GHRH analog. Its half-life ranges from 8-10 days in humans.<span class="s33">1 </span>This is due to its high affinity for compartmentalizing with serum albumin, a binding protein. About 90% of injected CJC-1295 winds up bound to albumin, which acts as a distribution vehicle. It provides a slow release of hormone back into free circulation over several weeks. The slow activity of CJC- 1295 is reflected in its pharmacokinetic profile.One human study found a single injection (30,60,125, or 250 mcg/kg) to elevate serum growth hormone 2 to 10 fold for up to 6 days. Serum IGF-I levels also rose by 1.5 to 3 fold in this same study, which persisted for up to 2 weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">CJC-1295 does not significantly influence peak levels of GH or IGF-I. It also does not appear to influence the number of GH/IGF-1 peak episodes per day (GH is released in pulses, usually 8-10 dailyj.These measures all remain stable during therapy. We note this is a second study, where researchers did reported a nearly 50% increase in total GH and IGF-1 secretion after administration of 60-90 mcg/kg.<span class="s33">2 </span>Looking very closely at the timing and levels though, they found the increase was in basal secretion.That is, the lows or &quot;trough levels&quot; of hormone that occur in-between GH pulses. With CJC-1295,your&quot;low periods&quot;are significantly higher.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">GHRH and ghrelin are the two primary positive regulators of growth hormone secretion in humans. These two hormones are the core focus of drugs of the GHRH and GHRP class, respectively. It is of note that GHRH analogs tend to display more specificity for growth hormone release than GHRPs.That is because endogenous GHRH has less activity in other areas as compared to ghrelin, which seems to influence a more diverse set of systems. Studies examining the pharmacodynamics of CJC-1295 confirm this. They find it has no acute effect on cortisol, prolactin,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">LH (luteinizing hormone), or TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). Thus, we consider CJC-1295 a &quot;selective&quot; GH secretagogue, with a low likelihood of spillover side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1825">Note: The research designation for this compound is CJC- 1295. Its structure includes a drug affinity complex (DAC). Likewise, referring to this as &quot;CJC-1295 with DAC&quot; is incorrect. All CJC-1295 has DAC. CJC-1295 without DAC is the drug Mod GRF 1 -29.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Key Points:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Very Long Acting Moderate Effect on GH Influences Basal Secretion</p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">No effect on Peak Amplitude, Frequency High Specificity for GH</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 23pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="247" height="249" alt="image" src="img/Image_471.gif"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">GH secretion pattern before and after CJC-1295,90 mcg/kg.</p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Source: J Clin Endocrinol Metab 91:4792,2006</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1826">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">CJC-1295 was first described in 2005 by Jette et al.<span class="s33">3 </span>The drug  was  under  the  development  of  ConjuChem  in Montreal, Canada, which appeared focused on introducing it as a pharmaceutical product.

It differs by the substitution of four amino acids,  as  well  as  the  addition  of  a  reactive maleimidoproprionic acid group. This group covalently binds the protein to serum albumin, greatly extending its half-life in the body. The specific structure of CJC-1295 is Tyr-D-Ala-Asp-Ala-lle-Phe-Thr-GIn-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Lys-Val* Leu-Ala-GIn-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-GIn-Asp-lle-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys(Maleimidopropionyl)-NH2</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1828">Warnings:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">CJC-1295 is an unapproved new drug.

It is typically supplied in multi-dose vials containing 2mg or 5mg of dry lyophilized powder.  This  must  be  reconstituted  with  saline  or bacteriostatic water before use. All unused portions of this drug should be kept under refrigeration.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1830">Side Effects (General):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Common side effects  to CJC-1295  include  flushing, warmth, dizziness, and transient hypotension following injection. Other common side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Many side effects are dose dependent. In studies this drug appeared to be especially well tolerated at doses of 30 and 60 mcg/kg, while more significant side effects were noted with 125 and 250 mcg/kg doses. Also frequently reported are adverse effects typically associated with other types of growth  hormone  therapy,  such  as  water  retention (edema), joint pain (arthralgias), carpal tunnel syndrome,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1831">and numbness or tingling in the extremities. Note that the incidence of GH-related side effects tends to be lower with GHRP therapy as compared to traditional hGH.This is because GH/IGF-1 release is subject to the limits of endogenous synthesis, and as such the drug is less amenable to overdosing.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Injection site):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1832">The subcutaneous administration of this drug may cause redness, itching, pain, or lumps at the site of injection.

This may occur in individuals without preexisting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1833">Administration:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">CJC-1295 may be given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, or IV infusion. The subcutaneous route is most often applied.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This drug has not been approved for use in humans. Prescribing guidelines are unavailable.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, CJC-1295 is generally administered at a dosage of 1000-2000 mcg (1-2 mg). This is given 1-2 times per week. Cycles usually last 3-4 months, though programs of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">6  months  or  longer  are  not  uncommon.  During investigatory studies with this drug, significant antibody formation (which might reduce the effectiveness of CJC- <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>295) was not reported.This suggests that desensitization is not likely to be rapid, if It does occur.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1834">During clinical studies, CJC-1295 seemed to exert its optimal effect (tolerance, benefits) at a dosage of 30-60 mcg/kg. This was administered once every 7 or 14 days. The calculated amount would be roughly 2.5 to 5 mg for someone weighing 85 kg, which is similar to the common cumulative dosage range of CJC-1295 in the fitness community. Higher doses (up to 250 mcg/kg or 20 mg total for someone weighing 85 kg) were also well tolerated in studies, but with a higher incidence of side effects.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination Therapy:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">CJC-1295 (a GHRH) may be combined with a drug from the GHRP (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides) class, such as such as GHRP-2, GHRP-6, hexarelin, ipamorelin, or MK-677.

This drug mimics the activity of endogenous GHRH. It acts on the pituitary to stimulate the pulsatile release of growth hormone, an important regulator of metabolism and body composition. GH has been shown to reduce fat mass through several actions, including inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, the stimulation of <span style=" color: #393939;">fat </span>mobilization, and enhanced fat oxidation. Via stimulation of IGF-1, it is also an import participant in anabolism. Tesamorelin is approved in the United States for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. In the fitness community, this drug is widely used to support muscle growth and fat loss.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In human pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies, 2 mg of tesamorelin daily for 2 weeks was shown to significantly increase serum growth hormone levels.<span class="s33">1 2 </span>Elevations were noted in both basal hormone secretion and total GH pulse area, with no change in the frequency of GH pulses. This is consistent with other drugs of the GHRH class. During this study, mean overnight GH secretion increased by approximately 70% (from 0.7 to 1.2 mcg/L), and GH area under the curve increased by <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>similar amount (from 531 to 897 mcg/L). IGF-1 was also significantly increased with treatment. In this case, levels more than doubled (from <span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>48 mcg/L to 329 mcg/L).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 32pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1837">In  prolonged  human  studies,  the  strong  effect  of tesamorelin on the GH/IGF-I axis persists.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>After 3 months (12 weeks) of treatment at 2 mg daily, IGF-1 levels remained elevated by an average of 60% (from 1<span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>0.6 ng/mL to 176.6 ng/mL). After 6 months (26 weeks), approximately half (47.4%) and one-third (35.6%) of patients still had IGF-1 levels that were 2 and 3 standard deviations above normal for their age and gender, respectively. With regard to its apparent physical effects, long-term tesamorelin use was shown to significantly decrease trunk fat, total body fat mass, and waist circumference.<span class="s33">4 </span>At the same time, lean body  mass  (LBM)  increased,  underlining  its  distinct anabolic component.

Note that the incidence of GH-related side effects tends to be lower with GHRP therapy as compared to traditional hGH. This is because GH/IGF-1 release <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is </span>subject to the limits of endogenous synthesis, and as such the drug is less amenable to overdosing.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">During Phase III trials, no clinically meaningful mean changes  were  noted  in  liver  enzymes  (alkaline phosphatase), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin.

Sermorelin is a  portion  of  this  polypeptide  hormone,  specifically consisting of the first 29 of its 44 amino acid structure. As its name states very clearly, the biological activity of GHRH is to stimulate the synthesis of growth hormone, which occurs in the pituitary gland. Studies have shown, however, that the GHRH peptide can be partly truncated without sacrificing its GH stimulating ability.<span class="s33">1 </span>Sermorelin (GRF1- 29NH2) was developed based on this research, and shares the  full  biological  activity  of  GHRH  with  regard  to increasing  the  endogenous  production  of  growth hormone. Based on its structure and action, sermorelin is classified as a growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) or GH secretagogue.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Sermorelin, as an acetate salt, is used in clinical medicine for two primary applications. The first is to diagnose pituitary deficiency.The procedure involves measuring the serum growth hormone response over a <span style=" color: #393939;">1 </span>-2 hour window following a single IV infusion of sermorelin acetate.<span class="s33">2 </span>An intact    hypothalamo-pituitary-growth-hormone    axis should yield a predictable increase in the GH level. The second common medical application is the treatment of growth  hormone  deficiency  in  children.  As  with recombinant  growth  hormone  medications  (rHGH, somatropin), sermorelin acetate can provide the benefits of sustained elevations in GH, including enhanced IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor) output and increased linear height.<span class="s33">3 </span>Sermorelin is a very specific acting drug, and has no effect on prolactin, LH, FSH, insulin, cortisol, glucose, glucagon, or thyroid hormone levels.<span class="s33">4 </span>This also lends to its therapeutic potential.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Athletes are interested in sermorelin acetate for the same reasons they use recombinant human growth hormone. Among other things, growth hormone has anabolic and anti-catabolic  properties.  An  elevated  GH  level  may support new muscle tissue growth, and also enhance strength, energy levels, and connective tissues. GH is also a potent  modulator  of  fat  loss.  The  physique-  and performance-enhancing  properties  of  growth  hormone are widely accepted by the bodybuilding and competitive athletic communities, such that rHGH medications are very popular. Although sermorelin acetate has a much shorter history of use, it is slowly gaining acceptance among the community as a viable alternative to low dose growth hormone injections. It is also presently popular in anti­ aging medicine, where again it serves as an alternative to growth hormone in the treatment of age-related GH</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">deficiency (&quot;somatopause&quot;).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When comparing this drug to recombinant human growth hormone, sermorelin acetate does appear to be less effective  under  normal  therapeutic  conditions.  During clinical studies, fewer patients on average seem to respond favorably to therapy in contrast to somatropin, and for those that do respond the improvements are often less pronounced.<span class="s33">5  </span>Still, it would be a mistake to exclude sermorelin acetate as a viable therapeutic option. For example, studies have found that sermorelin acetate can result in significant increases in height velocity in children with GH deficiency.<span class="s33">6  </span>Furthermore, these improvements seem to be well sustained after one year of therapy.<span class="s33">7 8 </span>Antibodies to GHRH do develop in some patients during extended therapy, and may impair the potency of the drug.<span class="s33">9  </span>The  full  biological  relevance  of  this  antibody reaction, however, remains unclear.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Sermorelin is approved in the United States for the treatment of GH deficiency in children only. Prolonged studies treating adults with somatopause are lacking. One investigation looked at the effects of 2 mg sermorelin acetate per day for 6 weeks in a group of eleven healthy elderly men (aged 64 to 76) with low circulating IGF-1 levels.<span class="s33">10  </span>Various  measures  of  body  composition  and performance were recorded at the beginning and end of the study. As a result of treatment, there was a significant increase in nocturnal GH output, area under peak GH release, and GH peak amplitude.This was accompanied by improvements  in  certain  measures  of  strength  and endurance including upright row, shoulder press, and abdominal crunch. Many other measures did not reach statistical significance, however, which may reflect study limitations such as small population sizes and a short duration of intake.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Another investigation looked at the effects of sermorelin acetate in a group of HIV+ men with lipodystrophy.<span class="s33">1</span><span class="s50">1 </span>HIV lipodystrophy tends to be characterized by the abnormal distribution of fat cells and suppressed levels of growth hormone. During this investigation, 31 men aged 18 to 60 years were given 1 mg of sermorelin acetate or placebo by subcutaneous injection twice daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was a significant increase in serum IGF-1 in the sermorelin acetate group (104 ng/mL vs 6 ng/mL).This was accompanied by a favorable increase in lean body mass (+.9 kg vs -.3 kg) and decrease in visceral and  subcutaneous  fat.  Sermorelin  acetate  was  well tolerated, and did not result in any change in other health markers   including   blood   pressure,   cholesterol, triglycerides,  insulin,  or  hemoglobin.  None  of  the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">participants discontinued therapy due to side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Sermorelin  acetate  could  be  viewed  as  offering  a therapeutic  advantage  over  recombinant  growth hormone in some cases, in that it is less likely to result in GH excess.This is due to the fact that it relies on the body&#39;s own  hormone  synthesis  instead  of  exogenous supplementation.Thus, normal IGF-1 feedback inhibition is likely to help set a natural limit to the growth hormone stimulating effect.<span class="s33">12 </span>As such, hormone levels are more easily controlled with sermorelin acetate. Under normal conditions,  while  sermorelin  will  produce  significant elevations in GH and IGF-1,these levels should not exceed the high end of the normal range.<span class="s33">13 </span>Given this feature, sermorelin acetate may be a more comfortable option for some patients. Studies seem to support this notion, finding many of the same physical and metabolic benefits of GH injections, without reporting the same issues with insulin resistance, fluid retention, or muscle pain.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1849">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1850">Sermorelin acetate was developed during the early 1980s, and approved for prescription sale by the U.S. Food </a><span style=" color: #393939;">and </span>Drug Administration in 1997. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>was introduced to market under  the  brand  name  Geref  Diagnostic  by  the international biotechnologies firm Serono. As <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>name implies, it was primarily developed as a diagnostic tool. It was specifically used for evaluating potential pituitary deficiency in GH production. Given its effect on growth hormone levels, however, the drug was also approved by the FDA for the treatment of GH deficiency in children. Geref was never widely prescribed, however, especially <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>uses relating to childhood GH deficiency, where <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>was never  able  to  compete  with  somatropin.  Serono ultimately discontinued the product in October 2008, citing  supply  issues  with  the  active  pharmaceutical ingredient.<span class="s33">14 </span>This was the only company manufacturing sermorelin as a commercial product in the United States, thus it is no longer available as a stock pharmacy item.The active material sermorelin acetate is still made by at least one licensed supplier, however, so the drug remains available here as a compounded medicine.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1851">Geref Diagnostic was supplied in ampules containing dry lyophilized sermorelin acetate, equivalent to 50 mcg </a><span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>sermorelin.

Injection sites should be rotated to avoid irritation or the buildup of scar tissue. When used to evaluate pituitary capacity in adults, a single intravenous infusion of 1.0 mcg/kg body weight is administered in the morning after an overnight fast.This is followed by 60-120 minutes of periodic blood sampling to measure pituitary hormone output.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, sermorelin acetate is given by subcutaneous injection, it is typically administered at a dosage of 0.2 to</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1855">0.5 mg per day (200-500 mcg), which is given before sleep. Studies, however, do suggest that this drug is more effective when given twice daily.</a><span class="s33">15 </span>Therefore, it is often preferred to divide the total daily dosage into two applications, one in the morning and one in the evening. Cycles of sermorelin acetate usually last between 8 and 12 weeks. Some anti-aging practitioners will prescribe the medication for much longer periods of time, however, and cycles lasting 24-48 weeks are not uncommon. The hope is that the extended maintenance of youthful growth hormone levels will yield more significant physiological changes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability Trends:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Given its low financial value on global pharmaceutical markets, sermorelin acetate is subject to limited</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">availability worldwide.The preparations most commonly found diverted for bodybuilding use include those made by private compounding pharmacies in the United States, and those sold by gray market research chemical supply companies.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s66" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s68">1  </span>Stimulation <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">of growth </span>hormone secretion <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">with human growth </span>hormone releasing factors <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">(GRF1-44, </span>GRF1-40, GRF1-29) in normal subjects.

As its name suggests, this drug stimulates the release of growth hormone. GHRP-2 is presently available as a diagnostic drug for GH deficiency in some markets, where it is usually found under the generic name pralmorelin. GHRP-2 is a fairly potent stimulator of GH release. Though it only increases the body&#39;s own synthesis of this hormone, given proper dosing it can produce strong supraphysiological levels of GH on par with exogenous hGH (Human Growth Hormone) administration. It can also be significantly more cost effective in comparison, GHRP-2 is most commonly used in the fitness community for the purposes of fat loss and muscle gain, as well as an anti-aging therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">This drug belongs to the Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides (GHRP) class. These are all synthetic compounds that mimic, to some degree, the effects of ghrelin, an endogenous gastrointestinal peptide hormone.<span class="s33">1 </span>Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach at times of fasting (when unfed). This hormone stimulates receptors in various tissues including the hypothalamus, pituitary, and other regions of the brain, the sympathetic nervous system, the stomach, heart, pancreas, fiver, and intestines, and even adipose tissue. Ghrelin is most generally involved in the regulation of  food  intake,  body  composition,  and  glucose metabolism.<span class="s33">2 </span>Among other things, it has been shown to stimulate  appetite,  influence  taste,  modulate  sleep, stimulate gastric motility, emptying, and acid secretion, promote  lean  body  mass  retention,  improve  cardiac output, reduce inflammation, increase plasma glucose levels, and alter peripheral insulin sensitivity.<span class="s33">3</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 47pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="206" height="172" alt="image" src="img/Image_472.gif"/></span></p><p class="s239" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">-15 0     30   «0 »O 120</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: center;">GH Response to 2 mcg/kg IV dose of GHRP-2 in young (closed circles) and elderly (open circles) subjects.

Several other pituitary-secreted <span style=" color: #393939;">or </span>linked hormones may also be stimulated in the elevated presence of ghrelin, including ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), cortisol, and prolactin. On the other hand, ghrelin may serve  to  lower  insulin  secretion  and  suppress  LH (luteinizing  hormone).  Of  course,  depending  on  the therapeutic need, not all of this is desired. As <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>drug, ghrelin could produce spillover effects in other areas. This spillover tendency is reduced in many of the GHRP analogs, however, which are often more selective in their actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">GHRP-2 does have a tendency to moderately increase ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin levels.<span class="s33">7  </span>These would be regarded as spillover effects on other systems. However, it does still seem to display some selectivity. It is estimated to be between 2-3 times more potent at stimulating GH release than its most direct predecessor, GHRP-6.<span class="s33">8 </span>At the same  time,  the  appetite-stimulating  properties  are markedly lower. Some increase in appetite is still reported by a majority of users, however.<span class="s33">9 </span>This just occurs less commonly, and tends to be less profound and shorter lasting when it does. GHRP-2 is also regarded as less effective for injury healing in comparison. This might be linked to a lower level of spillover effect toward cortisol.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1857">Key Points:</a></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild/Moderate Increase in Appetite</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Strong Effect on GH</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Moderate Elevations in Cortisol</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1858">•   </a><span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Moderate Elevations in Prolactin</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This agent has a fairly long history for a class of agents that is regarded as relatively new from an approval and sales perspective. GHRP-2 was discovered by Dr. C. Y. Bowers at Tulane University, and first disclosed back in 1993.<span class="s33">10 </span>Dr. Bowers  is  a  prominent  figure  in  the  field  of  GH secretagogues,  and  is  credited  with  discovering  or providing key research on many of these compounds. Dr. Bowers partnered with Keken Pharmaceuticals to develop GHRP-2 as a drug product. After a series of clinical trials, the drug (as pralmorelin) gained approval in Japan for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency. It was launched in 2005 under the brand name GHRP Kaken 100 Injection.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 2012, this agent was also granted orphan drug status in the United States for the same application, where it is marketed by Sella Pharmaceuticals. GHRP-2 has also been investigated in several clinical trials for the treatment of short stature in children. However, though early results seemed  promising,  no  such  product  has  yet  been approved for this application.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1859">GHRP-2 is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#39;s (WADA) list of prohibited substances.

Also frequently reported are adverse effects typically associated with other types of growth hormone therapy, such as water retention (edema), joint pain (arthralgias), carpal tunnel syndrome, and numbness or tingling in the extremities. Note that the incidence of side effects tends to be lower with GHRP therapy as compared to traditional hGH. This is because GH/IGF-1 release is subject to endogenous synthesis, and as such the drug is</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">less amenable to overdosing.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1863">Side Effects (Injection site):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">The subcutaneous administration of this drug may cause redness, itching, pain, or lumps at the site of injection.

This may occur in individuals without preexisting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">GHRP-2 may be given orally, via intranasal administration, subcutaneous  (SC)  injection,  or  intramuscular  (IM) injection.  However,  given  its  high  cost  and  lower bioavailability via other routes, injection is used almost exclusively.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, GHRP-2 is usually administered at a dosage of</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">0.1 to 0.3 mg (100-300 mcg) per injection. This may be given 1 -3 times daily. If single episode dosing is preferred, this is taken before sleep. Day dose(s) are taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before feeding. This is to preserve optimal GH release, as elevated plasma fatty acids and/or glucose may blunt the GH elevating effects of GHRP-2. Total daily dosage generally does not exceed 900 mcg.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">It is common to taper up the dosage, beginning with 100 mcg per injection. The dosage may then be increased in increments of 50 mcg every 3-7 days, until a stable dosage is reached.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cycles of GHRP-2 usually last 3-4 months in length, though programs of 6 months or longer are not uncommon. Although desensitization to GHRPs may occur over time, this drug appears to maintain an acceptable level of effectiveness during longer cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1866">Combination Therapy:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drugs of the GHRP class are often combined with those of the  GHRH  (Growth  Hormone  Releasing  Hormone) category, such as sermorelin or CJC-1295.

Such combination therapy produces substantial synergy with regard to GH release, producing maximum GH elevations that are unobtainable with either drug alone?<span class="s33">14 </span>Note that injections of GHRP-2 are typically reduced to no more than 200 mcg each during combination therapy, and 600 mcg total per day.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Below is an example of combination therapy with GHRP-2</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark1867">COMBINATION THERAPY WITH GHRP-2</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 188%;text-align: center;">GHRP-2:    100-200mcg   1-3x daily Sermorelin:   100-200mcg   1-3x daily</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="309" height="168" alt="image" src="img/Image_473.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: center;">Effect of 1 mcg/kg GHRP-2 (circle), 1 mcg/kg Sermorelin (square), or Combination (triangle) on serum GH.

It is a first generation Growth Hormone Releasing Peptide (GHRP) to be more specific, one of the earliest drugs of this class to effectively raise serum GH.This agent is an agonist <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSRIa).<span class="s33">1 </span>It acts on these receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, which stimulates the release of growth hormone. Liver IGF- 1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1) may also be increased as a result. Provided an ample dose is given, the resulting GH spike from GHRP-6 can reach supraphysiological (higher than normal) levels, although there have been more potent drugs of this class to come after it. This agent is still widely used in the sports community though, most commonly as an appetite stimulant, and to support muscle growth and fat loss alongside other drugs.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">GHRP&#39;s are all based on Ghrelin,a gastric peptide hormone. Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach during times of fasting (between meals). It has activity in a wide range of body tissues including the brain and the sympathetic nervous system, the stomach, heart, pancreas, liver, and intestines, and even adipose tissue. Though its physiological effects are also diverse, this hormone is largely identified as helping to regulate food intake, body composition, and glucose metabolism. While all GHRPs are modeled after ghrelin, each has its own activity profile. Many are more selective toward GH elevations than the category&#39;s natural parent hormone.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">GHRP-6 is an early GHRP, and not regarded as highly selective. Though it does trigger substantial increases in serum growth hormone, there is also spillover in other areas. For one, GHRP-6 has a tendency to mildly increase ACTH  (adrenocorticotropic  hormone),  cortisol,  and prolactin levels.<span class="s33">2 </span>This may result in some unwanted side effects, especially if these hormones go beyond normal values (see Side Effects). Note, these levels seem to rise less noticeably than with GHRP-2. Like ghrelin and many drugs of the GHRP class, GHRP-6 is also noted for stimulating appetite and gastric motility. The orexigenic (appetite stimulating) effects are among the most notable features of this drug, in fact, and generally more intense than GHRP- 2 and other GHRPs. Unless diet is controlled, use of this drug usually coincides with a notable increase in caloric intake.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1870">Key Points:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Strong Increase in Appetite Moderate Effect on GH Mild Elevations in Cortisol</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="293" height="193" alt="image" src="img/Image_474.gif"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">Mild Elevations in Prolactin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">e</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s30" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Time (min)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">GH Response to 1 mcg/kg IV dose of GHRP-6 (Source: European Journal of Endocrinology (2002) 146 667-672)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1871">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">GHRP-6 was first described in 1984 by Bowers et al.<span class="s33">3 </span>It is among the earliest and most visible representatives of the growth hormone releasing peptides class of drugs. It has also been subject to the most study, including a great deal of investigation in human subjects. As research on GHRPs progressed throughout the 1990s, many new compounds began to take stage. Though the safety on GHRP-6 appeared to be very high, and its efficacy at increasing serum growth hormone more than acceptable, it slowly began losing favor to other more potent or selective GHRPs such as GHRP-2, hexarelin, and ipamorelin. Still, this drug became popular with compounding pharmacies in the United States during the mid 2000s, and remains so to this day.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">GHRP-6 is on the World Anti-Doping Agency&#39;s (WADA) list of prohibited substances. Screening for this drug began on a large scale during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.This drug is now specifically detectable, at least for a short window after use, during routine urine analysis. A blood sample is not required.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1872">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1873">GHRP-6 is not available as a pharmaceutical product.

Obesity, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, hyperglycemia, or elevated plasma fatty acids may impair the effectiveness of GHRP-6. This drug should never be used during pregnancy, with cancer, a history of cancer, diabetic retinopathy, sclerosing diseases of the liver or lungs, intracranial hypertension, or uncontrolled diabetes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1875">Side Effects (General):</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1876">Common side effects to GHRP-6 therapy include flushing, sweating, sleepiness, increased Gl motility, and increased appetite. Elevations in prolactin may also be a concern for individual with preexisting gynecomastia. Also frequently reported  with  GHRP-6  are  adverse  effects  typically associated with other types of growth hormone therapy, such as water retention (edema), joint pain (arthralgias), carpal tunnel syndrome, and numbness or tingling in the extremities. Note that the incidence of side effects tends to be lower with GHRP therapy as compared to traditional hGH. This is because GH/IGF-1 release is subject to endogenous synthesis, and as such the drug is less amenable to overdosing.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Injection site):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The subcutaneous administration of this drug may cause redness, itching, pain, or lumps at the site of injection.

This may occur in individuals without preexisting diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">GHRP-6 is given by subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, GHRP-6 is usually administered at a dosage of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">0.1 to 0.3 mg (100-300 mcg) per injection. This may be given 1-3 times daily. If single episode dosing is preferred, this may be taken before sleep. Day dose(s) are taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before feeding. This is to preserve optimal GH release, as elevated plasma fatty acids and/or glucose may blunt the GH elevating effects of GHRP-6. Total daily dosage of GHRP-6 generally does not exceed 900 mcg.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">It is common to taper up the dosage, beginning with 100 mcg per injection. The dosage may then be increased in increments of 50 mcg every 3-7 days, until a stable dosage is reached.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Cycles of GHRP-6 usually last 3-4 months in length,though programs of 6 months or longer are not uncommon. Although desensitization to GHRPs may occur over time, this drug appears to maintain an acceptable level of effectiveness during longer cycles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1878">Combination Therapy:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Drugs ofthe GHRP class are often combined with those of the  GHRH  (Growth  Hormone  Releasing  Hormone) category, such as sermorelin or CJC-1295. These two drug types  alter  GH  release  through  two  distinct  and complimentary mechanisms. Such combination therapy produces substantial synergy with regard to GH release, producing maximum GH elevations that are much higher than noted with either drug alone.<span class="s33">5 </span>Note that injections of GHRP-6 are typically reduced to no more than 200 mcg each during combination therapy, and 600 mcg total per day.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Below is an example of combination therapy with GHRP-6.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1879">COMBINATION THERAPY WITH GHRP-6</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GHRP-2:    100-200mcg  1-3x daily</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 181%;text-align: left;">GHRP-6:     100-200mcg   1-3x daily Sermorelin:    100-200mcg   1-3x daily</p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="261" height="245" alt="image" src="img/Image_475.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Effect of GHRP-6, GHRH, and their combination on GH (1 mcg/kg).

Hexarelin is also noted for increasing appetite.<span class="s33">4 </span>Anecdotally, however, this effect is less pronounced than it is with many of the other GHRPs.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hexarelin  has  been  studied  for  its  potential cardioprotective effects.<span class="s33">5 </span>This may be in part mediated by its binding to both GHSRIa and CD36 receptors in tissues of the cardiovascular system.The latter affinity is not noted in ghrelin, and thus is unique to certain synthetic growth hormone releasing peptides. Hexarelin has been studied in several human clinical trials for this. These investigations found the drug to be well tolerated, and among other things, to increase cardiac output and left ventricular ejection  fraction.  Research  suggests  it  may  hold therapeutic potential with cardiovascular diseases such as cardiac  fibrosis,  ischemic  heart  disease,  cardiac dysfunction, and atherosclerosis. More research will be needed before hexarelin can be widely adopted for such application.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1882">Key Points:</a></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild Increase in Appetite</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Strong Effect on GH</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Slight Elevations in Cortisol/Prolactin</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•   <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Rapid Desensitization</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1883">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hexarelin was first described in 1992 by R. Deghenghi et al.<span class="s33">6 </span>Between 1999 and 2002, this drug was the subject of several investigations on human subjects. Much of the research was focused on its potential to treat GH deficiency and its possible cardioprotective effects. Though these early results appeared to be favorable, this drug has not been pushed through for approval as a medicine. Further research appears to have been halted in the mid 2000s, so the commercial future of this GHRP is unclear. Hexarelin is on  the  World  Anti-Doping  Agency&#39;s  (WADA)  list  of prohibited substances. Screening for this drug began on a large scale during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It is now detectable, at least for a short window after use, during routine urine analysis. A blood sample is not required.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1884">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hexarelin is a synthetic hexapeptide with the chemical name His-D-2-methyl-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2.This is a short peptide chain of 6 amino acids, which is relatively</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">stable.

Prescribing guidelines are unavailable.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">When used for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, hexarelin is usually administered at a dosage of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">0.05 to 0.2 mg (50-200 mcg) per injection. This may be given 1-2 times daily. If single episode dosing is preferred, this is taken before sleep. Day dose (if used) is taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before a meal. This is to preserve optimal GH release, as elevated plasma fatty acids and/or glucose may blunt the GH elevating effects of GHRPs. Total daily dosage generally does not exceed 400 mcg.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">It is common to taper up the dosage, beginning with only 50 mcg per injection.

In studies giving hexarelin via IV infusion, the drug seemed to approach its maximum effect at about 2 mcg/kg of bodyweight.<span class="s33">9 </span>This dose was also only incrementally better than 1 mcg/kg, suggesting the point of maximum cost effectiveness is somewhere between 1-2 mcg/kg. This would equate to an individual dosage of 100-200 mcg for a person of 220 lbs. So no more than 400 mcg per day seems reasonable if giving the drug on two instances, and no more than 200 mcg with single episode dosing. Significantly more than this might be wasteful, and possibly increase the incidence of side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The body becomes desensitized to the GH-elevating effects of Hexarelin over time.<span class="s33">10 </span>For this reason, cycles are usually limited to 4 weeks in length. This time frame was chosen out of an abundance of caution. One study that examined desensitization found it does occur sometime after 4 weeks of use, and before 16 weeks (other time points were not examined). It is quite possible that longer cycles  can  be  used  without  noticing  significant downregulation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Some people alternately opt to use hexarelin in long cycles, but do so on an intermittent schedule.This may be once every 2nd or 3rd day instead of daily. Hexarelin has not been subject to extensive study in humans. As such, a full understanding of the phenomenon of desensitization, and an optimal intake schedule, are lacking.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">After each cycle, a minimum of 4 weeks is taken off of the drug.

This hormone  is  produced  endogenously  by  the  anterior pituitary gland, and exists at especially high levels during childhood. Its growth-promoting effects are broad, and can be separated into three distinct areas: bone, skeletal muscle, and internal organs. It also supports protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and mineral metabolism, and can stimulate the growth of connective tissues. Although vital to  early  development,  human  growth  hormone  is produced throughout adulthood. Its levels and biological role decline with age, but continue to support metabolism, muscle tissue growth/maintenance, and the management (reduction) of adipose tissue throughout life. Somatropin specifically  describes  pharmaceutical  human  growth hormone  that  was  synthesized  with  the  use  of recombinant  DNA  technology.  Somatropin  (rhGH)  is biologically equivalent to human growth hormone (hGH) of pituitary origin.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">In a medical setting, somatropin is used to help treat a variety of health conditions. It is most notably prescribed in cases of childhood growth disorders that are characterized by insufficient growth hormone production. While usually not fully corrective, somatropin use is often capable of substantially increasing the linear growth rate and overall height before further growth is halted in adolescence.This medication is also used to accelerate growth in children that were born small and failed to catch up by the age of two. Other uses include the treatment of short bowel syndrome, growth failure due to renal insufficiency, muscle wasting associated with HIV infection, and adult growth hormone deficiency.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin is also sometimes prescribed to healthy men and women who are aging. Growth hormone levels tend to decline as we get older, and many physicians believe that its supplementation to more youthful levels can help slow some of the damage of aging. Given its beneficial metabolic effects on muscle mass, strength, energy, cell regeneration, and fat loss, there are many supporters of this use, even if hGH may not specifically retard the aging process. Note that in order to prescribe hGH for adult hormone deficiency in the U.S., the patient must have a diagnosed pituitary disease or history of childhood GH deficiency. It is specifically illegal according to Federal law to prescribe growth hormone for any off-label use, which includes anti-aging and bodybuilding purposes.<span class="s50">9241</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin may be given by either subcutaneous or intramuscular  injection.  During  clinical  studies,  the</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">pharmacokinetic properties of somatropin following both methods  of  use  were  determined.  When  given  by subcutaneous injection, somatropin has a similar but moderately higher level of bioavailability (75% vs. 63%). The rate of drug metabolism following both routes was also very similar, with somatropin displaying a half-life of approximately 3.8 hours and 4.9 hours after subcutaneous and  intramuscular  injection,  respectively.  Baseline hormone levels are usually reached between 1<i><b>2 </b></i>hours and</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">18 hours following injection, with the slower times seen with intramuscular use. Given the delayed rise in IGF-1 levels, however, which can remain elevated 24 hours after hGH injection, the metabolic activity of human growth hormone will outlast its actual levels in the body. Although drug absorption is acceptable by both methods of use, daily subcutaneous administration is generally regarded as the preferred method of using somatropin.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">A specific analysis of somatropin activity shows a hormone with a diverse set of effects. It is anabolic to skeletal muscle, shown to increase both the size and number of cells (processes referred to as hypertrophy and hyperplasia, respectively). The hormone also seems to have growth­ promoting effects on all organs of the body excluding the eyes and brain. Somatropin has a diabetogenic effect on carbohydrate metabolism, which means that it causes blood sugar levels to rise (a process normally associated with diabetes). Excessive administration of somatropin over time may induce a state of type-2 (insulin resistant) diabetes.  This  hormone  also  supports  triglyceride hydrolysis in adipose tissue, and may reduce body fat stores. Coinciding with this tends to be a reduction in serum cholesterol.The drug also tends to reduce levels of potassium, phosphorous, and sodium, and may cause a decrease in levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3). The latter effect marks a reduction in thyroid- supported  metabolism,  and  can  interfere  with  the effectiveness of extended therapy with somatropin.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Growth hormone has both direct and indirect effects. On the direct side, the hGH protein attaches to receptors in muscle, bone, and adipose tissues, sending messages to support anabolism and lipolysis (fat loss).Growth hormone also directly increases glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis) in the liver, and induces insulin resistance by blocking its activity in target cells. The indirect effects of growth hormone  are  largely  mediated  by  IGF-1  (insulin-like growth factor), which is produced in the liver and virtually all other tissues in response to growth hormone. IGF-1 is also anabolic to both muscle and bone, augmenting growth hormone&#39;s activity. IGF-1, however, also has effects that are strongly antagonistic to growth hormone. This</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">includes increased lipogenesis (fat retention), increased glucose consumption, and decreased gluconeogenesis. The synergistic and antagonists effects of these two hormones  combine  to  form  the  character  of  hGH. Likewise, they also dictate the effects of somatropin administration,  which  include  the  support  lipolysis, increased serum glucose levels, and reduced insulin sensitivity.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin is considered to be a controversial anabolic and  performance-enhancing  drug  in  the  realm  of bodybuilding and athletics. The main issue of debate is the exact level of potential benefit this substance carries. While studies with HIV+ patients in a wasting state tend to support  potentially  strong  anabolic  and  anticatabolic properties, studies demonstrating these same effects in healthy adults and athletes are lacking. During the 1980s, a large body of myth surrounded discussions of hGH in bodybuilding circles, which may have been fueled by the high cost of the drug and its very name (&quot;growth hormone”). It was once thought to be the most powerful anabolic substance you could buy. Today, recombinant human growth hormone is much more affordable and readily obtained. Most experienced individuals now tend to agree that it is the fat-loss-promoting properties of somatropin that are most obvious.The drug can support muscle growth, strength gains, and increased athletic performance, but its effects are generally milder than those  of  anabolic/androgenic  steroids.  For  a  highly advanced athlete or bodybuilder, however, somatropin can help push body and performance further than might have been possible with steroids alone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1904">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first human growth hormone preparations to be used in medicine were made from pituitary extracts of human origin. These are now commonly referred to as cadaver growth hormone preparations. Approximately 1 mg of hGH (a 1 day dose) could be obtained from each cadaver. The first successful treatment with human cadaver GH was reported in 195 8 <span class="s50">9252 </span>Soon after these medicines were introduced to market, and were sold in the U.S. until 1985. The Food and Drug Administration banned them that year after they had been linked to the development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob&#39;s disease (CJD), a highly degenerative and ultimately fatal brain disorder, in a number of patients.The disease can be transmitted from one person to  another  under  exceptional  circumstances  (usually blood transfusion or organ implantation are involved), and was likely caused by the extraction of hGH from infected cadavers. CJD has a very slow incubation period, and has been diagnosed anywhere from 4 to 30 years after therapy with growth hormone of cadaver origin. As of 2004 estimates, at least 26 patients that received</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">cadaver GH drugs in the United States have been diagnosed with the disease.<span class="s33">9263 </span>The overall incidence of this disease is less than <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">1%, </span>as approximately 6,000 patients  are  documented  to  have  received  the medication.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1905">The FDA approved the first synthetic human growth hormone  drug  in 1985. Synthesis produced  a pure hormone  without  biological  contamination,  eliminating the possibility of CJD transmission. The drug approved was called somatrem (Protropin), and was based on a manufacturing technology developed by Genentech in 197 9 </a><span class="s33">9274 </span>Somatrem came at an important time given the removal of cadaver GH by the FDA that same year. This hormone is actually a slight variant of the hGH protein, but displays the same biological properties ofthe natural hormone. Protropin was initially very successful being it was the first synthetic GH product. By 1987, however, Kabi Vitrum  (Sweden)  had  published  methods  for  the production of pure synthetic somatropin with the exact amino  acid  sequence  of  endogenous  growth hormone.<span class="s33">9285 </span>It was also discovered that the unnatural structure of somatrem causes a much higher incidence of antibody reactions in patients, which can reduce drug efficacy.<span class="s33">9296 </span>Somatropin would come to be viewed as a more  reliable  drug,  and  would  dominate  the global market within several years. Today, although somatrem products  are  still  sold,  somatropin  retains  the  vast majority of hGH sales worldwide.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1906">Somatropin is most commonly supplied in multi-dose vials containing a white lyophilized powder that requires reconstitution with sterile or bacteriostatic water before use.

The abuse of somatropin may cause diabetes, acromegaly (a visible thickening of the bones, most notably the feet, forehead, hands, jaw, and elbows), and enlargement of the internal organs. Due to the growth promotion effects of human growth hormone, this drug should not be used by individuals with active or recurring cancer.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Impaired glucose tolerance):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin may reduce sensitivity to insulin and raise blood sugar levels.

One   milligram   of somatropin is equivalent to approximately 3 International Units (3 IU). When used to treat adult onset growth hormone deficiency, the drug is commonly applied at a dosage of .005/mg/kg per day to .01mg/kg per day. This equates to roughly 1 IU to 3 IU per day for person of approximately 180-220 lbs. A long-term maintenance dosage is established after reviewing the patient&#39;s IGF-1 levels and clinical response over time.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When  used  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes, somatropin is usually administered at a dosage between 1 IU and 6 IU per day (2-4 IU being most common). The drug is commonly cycled in a similar manner to anabolic/androgenic steroids, with the length of intake generally being between 6 weeks and 24 weeks. The anabolic effects of this drug are less apparent than its lipolytic (fat loss) properties, and generally take longer periods of time and higher doses to manifest themselves.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Other drugs are commonly used in conjunction with somatropin in order to elicit a stronger response.Thyroid drugs (usually T3) are particularly common given the known effects of somatropin on thyroid levels, and may significantly enhance fat loss during therapy. Insulin is also commonly used with somatropin.

Anabolic steroids may also further increase free IGF-1 levels via a lowering  of  IGF  binding  proteins.<span class="s33">9329  </span>Note  that  the stacking of somatropin with thyroid drugs and/or insulin is usually approached with great care and caution, given that  these  are  particularly  strong  medications  with potentially serious or life threatening acute side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin  is  produced  by  many  different  drug companies, and is distributed in virtually all developed countries.  The  most  common  brand  names  include Serostim (Serono), Saizen (Serono), Humatrope (Eli Lilly), Norditropin  (novo  nodisk),  Omnitrope  (Sandoz),  and Genotropin (Pharmacia).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Somatropin products are high value targets for drug counterfeiting operations. Many counterfeits are highly deceptive in nature, and have been found in both illicit and  legitimate  drug  distribution  channels.  Some counterfeit  growth  hormone  products  are  made  by relabeling vials of hCG, which bear a very close visual resemblance to somatropin. A home pregnancy test is sometimes used to help determine if hCG has been used to make a counterfeit hGH product. This test works by detecting hCG in the urine. A few days into a cycle with somatropin, the individual will take a 3-4 IU injection prior to bed. Upon rising, the pregnancy test will be used, and a positive result will indicate that an hCG counterfeit has been used. The powder in the vial of somatropin should also be in the form of a solid (lyophilized) disc. Do not take any product that contains loose powder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s65" style="padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1 <span class="s66">Section. 3O3(e)(1)/FOCA, 21 U.S.C. 333(e)(1)</span></p><p class="s65" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: left;">2  <span class="s66">Treatment of pituitary dwarf with human growth hormone.

More specifically, it belongs to the GHRP (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides) class.These drugs all mimic the activity of ghrelin on the growth hormone secretagogue receptor la (GHSRla), which stimulates the pulsatile secretion of this hormone from the pituitary. Ibutamoren is considered a third generation GHRP, mostly for its refined oral bioavailability. In human studies, it has been shown to significantly elevate serum GH and IGF-1 levels in both the young and elderly,<span class="s33">1 2 3 </span>increase fat-free mass and energy expenditure,<span class="s33">4  </span>improve sleep quality,<span class="s33">5  </span>and reduce diet- induced catabolism.<span class="s33">6 </span>In the fitness community, this drug is most commonly used for muscle gain and fat loss, as well as an appetite stimulant.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The activity profile of ibutamoren would be most closely compared to that of GHRP-6. Both drugs are potent stimulators of growth hormone release. However, neither is selective for this activity. As with GHRP-6, ibutamoren is likely  to  also  result  in  mild  increases  in  ACTH (adrenocorticotropic  hormone),  cortisol,  and  prolactin levels. Related spillover side effects are always possible, though not especially common or noteworthy with this drug. In most cases the spillover increases in these other hormones are modest, and not outwardly noticeable to the user. Ibutamoren is also a moderately strong appetite stimulant. Be aware that unless diet is controlled, the use of this drug may coincide with a significant increase in daily caloric intake. When diet is controlled, its GH-stimulating properties may support fat loss.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1914">Key Points:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Moderate/Strong effect on Appetite</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Moderate Effect on GH</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">•    <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Miid Elevations in Cortisol</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1915">■   </a><span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">Mild Elevations in Prolactin</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ibutamoren was first described in 1995 by Patchett et al.<span class="s33">7 </span>It was developed during research into novel spiropiperidine derivatives. A series of these compounds had been synthesized   and   assessed   for   structure/activity relationship as GHRPs. During these experiments, the researchers specifically sought to &quot;optimize each structural component&quot;of an intermediary molecule of great interest, and develop a drug with high oral and therapeutic efficacy. The final result was ibutamoren. Among the common representatives of the GHRP category, it stands out as the most orally active and viable.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Ibutamoren  has  been  under  investigation  as  a pharmaceutical by Merck. The company actually pushed the drug into early human clinical trials, examining its effect on such conditions such as fibromyalgia, muscular atrophy, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, fracture, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and growth hormone deficiency.The studies thus far have found the drug to be well tolerated. While not all clinical endpoints were successfully met during these studies, it did consistently elevate serum IGF-1. Further, it does appear there could be some therapeutic value. However, full clinical trials were never completed. Merck may have abandoned it. Likewise, the future of ibutamoren is unclear at this time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="264" height="199" alt="image" src="img/Image_477.gif"/></span>	<span><img width="273" height="190" alt="image" src="img/Image_478.gif"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 126pt;text-indent: -93pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Mean GH (left) and IGF-1 (right) change with 10 mg and 25 mg oral ibutamoren given once daily to elderly subjects.

IGF-1 is the primary mediator of the growth promoting effects of human growth hormone. As such, mecasermin also can stimulate the growth of bone, muscle, and internal organs. Its effects on skeletal muscle are also strongly hyperplasic, meaning it causes an increase in cell number. Unlike hGH, however, mecasermin has very strong insulin­ like effects. It can support growth by increasing the uptake of amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids, but lowers blood sugar levels so efficiently that it can induce severe hypoglycemia if too high a dosage is taken. The increased uptake of fatty acids also means that mecasermin may promote lipogenesis, or an increase in the storage of body fat.This agent is of interest to bodybuilders and athletes for its potential to support the growth of skeletal muscle and connective tissue.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Mecasermin  is  most  commonly  prescribed  for  the treatment of severe primary IGF-1 deficiency (Primary IGFD). This disease is characterized by a failure to produce normal levels of IGF-1 due to insufficiencies in the growth hormone <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">/ </span>IGF-1 axis (usually involving GH receptor, signaling pathway, or IGF-1 gene defects). Such patients typically have normal or even high levels of growth hormone, but their bodies do not respond to it with the sufficient production of IGF-1. Mecasermin may also be used for the treatment of patients who have developed antibodies to growth hormone therapy. In both instances the patient is not GH deficient, but does not respond properly to growth hormone therapy, making IGF-1 an effective alternative medication. Given its differing effects on metabolism, however, mecasermin is not considered to be a medical substitute for hGH therapy, and retains a narrow field of FDA approved uses.</p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1925">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved Mecasermin in August 2005.

Approximately 7% of patients noticed severe hypoglycemia, and 5% noticed hypoglycemic seizure or loss  of  consciousness.  Signs  of  mild  to  moderate hypoglycemia include hunger, drowsiness, blurred vision, depressive mood, dizziness, sweating, palpitation, tremor, restlessness, tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue, lightheadedness, inability to concentrate, headache, sleep disturbances, anxiety, slurred speech, irritability, abnormal behavior, unsteady movement, and personality changes. If any of these warning signs should occur, one should immediately consume a food or drink containing simple sugars such as a candy bar or carbohydrate drink. Signs of severe hypoglycemia include disorientation, seizure, and unconsciousness. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to death and  requires  immediate  emergency  medical  attention.

Mild elevations in serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels were found in a significant number of patients, but they were not associated with hepatotoxicity. Mecasermin can stimulate the  growth  of  internal  organs.  Kidney  and  spleen hypertrophy was particularly pronounced in the first years of long-term therapy in clinical trials, without declining renal function. Elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides were also observed, but remained within the upper limit of normal values. Evidence of heart enlargement was observed in a few patients, but this appeared without any apparent clinical significance. The overall relationship between mecasermin use and cardiac changes has not yet been fully assessed. Thickening of facial soft tissues was observed in several patients, and should be monitored during therapy. The abuse of mecasermin may cause acromegaly, which is characterized by a visible thickening of the bones, most notably the feet, forehead, hands, jaw, and elbows. Due to the growth promotion effects of hlGF- 1, this drug should not be used by individuals with active or recurring cancer.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1932">Administration:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Mecasermin is intended for subcutaneous administration. The initiation of therapy involves close monitoring of blood glucose levels until a proper maintenance dose is established. The recommended starting dose is .04 to .08 mg/kg (40 to 80 mcg/kg) twice daily. The dose may be increased  by  .04  mg/kg  per  injection,  reaching  a maximum of .12 mg/kg twice daily. Doses greater than .12 mg/kg are not advised due to potential hypoglycemic effects. Mecasermin should always be administered within 20 minutes (before or after) a meal or snack.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mecasermin  is  not  widely  used  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing purposes. Common protocols of administration have not yet been established. Due to the potential  for  severe  hypoglycemia,  maximum  doses among  bodybuilders  and  athletes  are  not  likely  to measurably  exceed  those  supplied  by  therapeutic guidelines. This drug will most likely by taken in cycles lasting no longer than 8-12 weeks in an effort to minimize unwanted organ growth or fat gain.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1933">Availability:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mecasermin is approved for sale in the United States and Europe under the Increlex brand name.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ipamorelin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1934">Description:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ipamorelin is a growth hormone secretagogue from the GHRP class (Growth Hormone Releasing Peptides).This is a third generation GHRP. It was developed alongside a series of other modified derivatives of a first generation GHRP.<span class="s33">1 </span>Like other GHRPs, ipamorelin binds and activates growth hormone  secretagogue  receptor  1a  (GHSRIa).  This supports the pulsatile release of growth hormone, and in turn potentially IGF-1. As a stimulator of GH release, ipamorelin appears to be moderately potent. It is stronger than GHRP-6, but less effective than GHRP-2. However, it does have unique properties regarding selectivity that make this drug of interest, discussed below. In the fitness community, ipamorelin is most often used for the support of muscle growth and fat loss.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Ipamorelin is highly selective for the stimulation of growth hormone release. This means minimal spillover effects on other systems. For starters, ipamorelin has been shown to only slightly increase ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) and cortisol levels.These increases are far less notable than with the non-selective GHRPs to come before it, and no more in intensity than the natural hormone GHRH. Further, this effect does not appear to be dose dependent. Related side effects are unlikely. Further, ipamorelin appears to have negligible effect on appetite.

If single episode dosing is preferred, this is taken before sleep, sometimes at a higher dose (up to 500 mcg). Day dose(s) are taken on an empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before a meal.

It is a close derivative of this natural protein. The name &quot;Long R3” actually describes how the original IGF-1 protein has been modified. It is made by extending the IGF-1 protein with a chain of 13 amino acids, and substituting an arginine at the 3rd position. This new synthetic form of IGF-1 seems to retain much of the hormone&#39;s original biological activity. It binds and activates the IGF-1 receptor with similar affinity,and imparts a similar anabolic effect. However, it also differs by displaying a significantly  longer  half-life,  and  higher  resistance  to binding proteins, in comparison.<span class="s33">71 </span>Asa result, milligram for milligram, Long(R3)-IGF-l is estimated to be approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">2.5 to 3 times more potent than natural IGF-1.<span class="s33">72 </span>In the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">fitness community, this substance is most commonly used to support increases in muscle mass.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">IGF-1 is an important hormone for human development. Its levels  are  especially  high  during  childhood  and adolescence, where it supports linear growth, as well as the growth of nearly all body tissues. Serum IGF-1 levels decline greatly  in  adulthood,  though  remain  substantial throughout  life.  This  hormone  will  continue  to  play important roles in metabolism and physiology, including the support of skeletal muscle mass and strength. IGF-1 has several key anabolic/anti-catabolic activities. It supports the synthesis of new muscle protein, satellite cell activity, and the incorporation of new nuclei into muscle cells. It is also noted for reducing the activity of both p27Kip1<span class="s33">73 </span>and myostatin,<span class="s33">7475 </span>which are two powerful inhibitors of muscle growth. As such, IGF-I is regarded as possessing both strong anabolic and anti-catabolic properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Long(R3)-IGF-l belongs to the Growth Hormone and Related family of drugs.This is because IGF-I levels increase in  response  to  growth  hormone  administration.  This hormone is actually responsible for most of all of anabolic effect of hGH (somatropin) therapy. Likewise, the two have a very direct relationship in the body. However, it is worth noting that Long(R3)-IGF-l use is likely to be qualitatively different from that of hGH. While its anabolic effects are presumed  to  be  similar,  GH  imparts  a  substantial thermogenic effect that is not replicated with Long(R3)- IGF-l.To the contrary, the drug can actually have lipogenic properties similar to insulin. In some users, it increases the tendency for fat gain, not fat loss. Likewise, Long(R3)-IGF-l would be most closely compared to Increlex (rhIGF-l)</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">therapy instead. Its use is typically characterized by intensified  pumps,  increased  appetite,  and  moderate increases  in  lean  muscle  mass  and  strength.  The stimulation of thermogenesis (fat loss) is not one of this drug’s most noteworthy properties.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1947">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1948">Long(R3)-IGF-1 was first described in 1992 by Francis et al.</a><span class="s33">76 </span>It was one of several IGF-I analogs synthesized by this group.

Its similar biological action to IGF-I, resistance to binding proteins, and prolonged half-life appears to make it an excellent substitute for IGF-I in many experiments,  especially  when  IGF-I  itself  proves problematic to use. The study on Long(R3)-IGF-l has not progressed to human clinical trials, however.

Signs of mild to moderate hypoglycemia include hunger, drowsiness, blurred vision, depressive mood,  dizziness,  sweating,  palpitation,  tremor, restlessness, tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue, lightheadedness, inability to concentrate, headache, sleep disturbances, anxiety, slurred speech, irritability, abnormal behavior, unsteady movement, and personality changes. If any of these warning signs should occur, one should immediately consume a food or drink containing simple sugars such as a candy bar or carbohydrate drink. Signs of severe hypoglycemia include disorientation, seizure, and unconsciousness. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to death and requires immediate emergency medical attention. Note that in some cases the symptoms of hypoglycemia can be mistaken for drunkenness.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1952">Long(R3)-IGF-l should never be taken before sleep or in higher than recommended doses.

Enlargement of the kidney, spleen, and </a><span style=" color: #393939;">heart </span>were all noted in studies with recombinant IGF-1 therapy. Elevations in cholesterol and triglycerides were also observed.The overall relationship between Long(R3)-IGF- I use and cardiac changes remains unclear.Thickening of facial  soft  tissues  is  also  possible, and  should be monitored. The abuse of Long(R3)-IGF-l may cause acromegaly, which is characterized by a visible thickening of the bones, most notably the feet, forehead, hands, jaw, and elbows.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Long(R3)-IGF-l has not been approved for use in humans.

A dosage of 20-80 mcg daily is most commonly used. This is given in one application, usually  earlier  in  the  day.  A  meal  with  sufficient carbohydrate content is consumed within 20 minutes of injection to help reduce the likelihood of hypoglycemia. Long(R3)-IGF-l is often injected into the muscle that will be trained that day, in an effort to support site-specific growth. However, the efficacy of this practice remains unclear.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is generally advised to taper-up the dosage of Long(R3)- IGF-I. The user often begins on the low end of the dosage range (20 mcg), and increases the amount by 5-10 mcg every 3-4 days, until a desired stable dosage is reached. This practice can help acclimate the user to the effects of Long(R3)-IGF-l,  especially  its  potential  blood-sugar- lowering properties (see: Side Effects).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cycles of Long(R3)-IGF-l usually last 30-40 days.

It was discovered in 1996, when it was found to be a natural &quot;splice variant&quot; of IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor). That is, it is an alternate sequence of IGF-1 that is produced locally within the muscles when they are stretched or damaged, as with resistance training.’<span class="s33">2 </span>This new form of IGF-1 seems to trigger some of the early changes within the cells that support repair and growth, making it of great interest in both medical research and sports doping.<span class="s33">3 </span>The technical label for this variant of IGF-1 is human IGF-IEc. However, it is often called MGF because it appears to play a key role in translating  mechanical  activity  into  anabolic  signaling (growth).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The physiological activity of MGF (human IGF-IEc) has not been fully characterized. What we do know is that this hormone acts in a local or paracrine fashion to support the repair of skeletal and cardiac muscles after damage. Protein synthesis is upregulated in response to MGF. Perhaps more interestingly, it stimulates the satellite cell cycle.<span class="s33">4 </span>MGF has been specifically shown to activate quiescent satellite cells. These  then  proliferate,  which  expands  the  pool  of precursor cells that are available to use for repair and growth. The satellite cell cycle is a core part of ongoing hypertrophy. It ultimately contributes nuclei to expanding muscle cells, which allows them to continue managing their growing volume efficiently. Hypertrophy simply halts without it.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">It  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  anabolic  steroid administration has been shown to substantially increase the post-exercise expression of mechano growth factor.<span class="s33">5 </span>This suggests there is some direct androgen regulation of MGF splicing in skeletal muscle. More research is needed on serum androgen differences in the MGF response, of course. But these findings do underline just how robust steroids are as anabolic drugs, and how they influence muscle  growth  via  diverse,  not  isolated,  pathways. Potentially further, that some of their effects can be replicated with  other substances. More work will be needed to fully elucidate the potential synergies between anabolic steroids and drugs from the growth hormone family.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Complicating our discussion about MGF as a drug, however, is the fact that several different variants of this protein have been used during scientific studies. Though seemingly similar, some pharmacodynamic differences</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">have been observed.<span class="s33">6 </span>Likewise, the research on MGF can easily become confused if one is not aware of the subtle differences  between  these  proteins.  The  three  most popular forms of MGF are reviewed below. However, it is important to point out that this list is not inclusive. Other variants have been used in scientific researches well in the realm of sports doping.<span class="s33">7 8 </span>Until such time as this protein is developed into one standardized drug, confusion among consumers is likely to persist.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Native MGF: <span class="p">This is natural human MGF (IGF-IEc). Native MGF contains a sequence of 110 amino acids. It is formed when the body produces an alternate splicing of IGF-1 (normally 70 amino acids). Full length MGF is a complex and expensive protein to manufacture. It is available for research purposes, though is rarely found outside of the lab.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Truncated Native MGF: <span class="p">This is a shortened form of native MGF, consisting of its c-terminal sequence of 24 amino acids. This is considered to be the hypertrophic &quot;active domain&quot; of the MGF protein, retaining all of its anabolic  properties.  As  a  much  shorter  chain,  this truncated MGF is easier to manufacture than full length MGF, and should be much more stable. This is the MGF protein most commonly used in the fitness community.For the most part, when we are talking about MGF as a drug, we&#39;re talking about this protein.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Goldspink MGF: <span class="p">This is a modified form of Truncated Native MGF. It is named after the scientist that discovered MGF, and also developed this more stable analog. In this protein, two arginine residues are replaced with D-arginine, and a third at position 23 is replaced with histidine. This compound is sometimes also called &quot;R23H MGF’.&#39;It is available and used in the fitness community, but less commonly than Truncated Native MGF. It should be significantly more effective, however. This is generally the preferred form of MGF.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As with many other peptides, MGF proteins are also available in both regular and &quot;pegylated&quot; form. Regular is just straight MGF protein. The substance is still effective when administered in this form, though is extremely fast acting. Regular MGF requires daily injections in order to be therapeutically viable. Pegylation is much slower acting. This  involves  attaching  a  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG) molecule to the protein. Pegylation protects MGF from enzymatic degradation, greatly extending its half-life. This type of MGF protein requires only 2-3 injections per week, which seems much more viable for most users. Pegylated</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">mechano growth factor or&quot;PEG MGF&quot;is the most common type of MGF available today.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Research on mechano growth factor is still in its early stages. The data so far is highly encouraging, but also limited. What we know of the anabolic effect of MGF is largely gleaned from anecdotal reports.The feedback has been mixed. It is also likely to vary depending on what MGF protein is used, the manner in which it is used, and of course, its purity. At this time it is very difficult to draw concrete conclusions. Detailed human studies into the different MGF proteins, as well as their optimal dosing and usage protocols, are needed.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1957">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1958">Mechano Growth Factor was first described in 1996 by Goldspink et al.</a><span class="s33">9 </span>Shortly after its isolation, a series of MGF variants  were  synthesized  and  studied.  Many  MGF proteins are based on a shortened form of the native hormone, specifically its c-terminal sequence of 24 amino acids.This has been shown to be the active core moiety of MGF; the only essential part for imparting anabolic effects. Though animal studies on this family of compounds has returned some promising early data, MGF does not appear poised to enter clinical trials and pharmaceutical development at this time. However, research on this hormone does continue. MGF is on WADA&#39;s list of prohibited substances, and methods for its detection (at least some of the variants) are available.<span class="s33">10</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">This drug is not available as a pharmaceutical product.

Standard dosage information is unavailable.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Regular MGF: When used for physique- or performance­ enhancing purposes, Regular MGF is usually administered at a dosage of 50-200 mcg. This is generally given via IM injection(s) once daily, immediately following exercise in the muscle(s) trained. Regular MGF is typically taken on training days only, but as many as 5-6 days per week.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The daily dosage of Regular MGF may be further divided across multiple injections into the muscles just trained. This is in an effort to support enhanced site-specific muscle growth. For example, a 200-mcg dosage may be split into 4 injections of 50 mcg each, administering 2 in <span style=" color: #393939;">each </span>bicep. The efficacy of this practice is unclear, <span style=" color: #393939;">but </span>supported anecdotally</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">PEG MGF: When used for physique-enhancing purposes, PEG-MGF is usually administered at a dosage of 150-300 mcg. This is typically given by IM or subcutaneous injection, 2-3 times per week. Some do follow a similar practice to Regular MGF, dividing the dosage into multiple IM injections within each of the muscles just trained. However, many are less inclined to do so given the slower activity of this drug, and its more comfortable injection schedule. Again, best practices have yet to be established.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1964">Cycles of MGF usually last 2-3 months, though longer programs are not uncommon.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Combination Therapy:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">MGF has been shown to support the early proliferative stage of the satellite ceil cycle.

Note  that  the  quality  of  gray  market products can be difficult to assure. In our experience, MGF can be an especially risky product to purchase from unknown sources. It is expensive and difficult to source, which  increases  (greatly)  the  likelihood  it  will  be substituted with something else.

These compounds are based on GHRH, a natural peptide hormone that signals the release of GH from the pituitary gland. GHRH is one of two primary positive regulators of GH secretion in humans, acting together with ghrelin. Both hormones are the subjects of extensive drug development. With GHRH, though it can be synthesized as a drug product, it is not really adequate as a therapeutic agent. It is too short acting. Mod GRF 1-29 is potentially more viable. It is a shortened, modified form of GHRH that is more resistant to enzymatic cleavage. It has a longer half-life, and is a more potent agent for increasing serum GH and IGF-1 levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Mod GRF 1-29 is almost identical to CJC-1295 in structure. It  differs  only  by  the  lack  of  an  attached maleimidoproprionic acid group, also known as Drug Affinity Complex (DAC). DAC temporarily binds CJC-1295 to serum albumin, greatly extending its half-life. Th is is why Mod GRF 1-29 is also commonly called &quot;CJC-1295 without DAC/’lt simply lacks this complex. Because of this, Mod GRF 1-29 is much shorter acting. It has a half-life measured in minutes or hours instead of days. Whereas CJC-1295 can be injected weekly, Mod GRF 1-29 is usually injected several times daily. Otherwise, these two are the same drug... the same active peptide. In the fitness community, Mod GRF 1- 29 is used for the support of muscle growth and fat loss,as well as its potential anti-aging properties.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Much of what else can be said of CJC-1295 should hold true for Mod GRF 1-29. Most basically, this is to be considered a &quot;selective&quot; GH secretagogue. It displays a great deal of specificity for growth hormone release, and is unlikely to significantly alter levels of cortisol, prolactin, LH (luteinizing  hormone),  or  TSH  (thyroid  stimulating hormone).  Likewise,  significant  spillover  side  effects pertaining to these hormones, which are common to many drugs of the GHRP class that mimic ghrelin, are unlikely with Mod GRF 1 -29.That isn&#39;t to say the Mod GRF 1 -29 and CJC-1295 are interchangeable.

First, the active 29 amino acids of GHRH were synthesized in a compound  called  GRF  1-29.  Today  we  know  it  as sermorelin, an approved drug product. Though viable, scientists  still  struggled  with  its  short  half-life,  and continued to seek out alternatives.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Jette etal sought to further modify the 29 amino acids that make  up  sermorelin  in  ways  that  might  reduce  its tendency for cleavage, yet still retain biological activity as a GH secretagogue. A tetrasubstituted derivative called CJC- 1295 was one of the most promising compounds to result from their work. This is the same peptide Mod GRF 1-29 that is described here, but with an additional Drug Affinity Complex to slow its distribution. Subsequent work on this substance continued as CJC-1295. Documentation on actual Mod GRF 1-29 is hard to come by. Neither form of this peptide is presently an approved drug product, in spite of some favorable early human studies.

Four substitutions to GRF 1 -29 create this new peptide: D-Ala at the 2-position, Gin at the 8-position, Ala at position 15, and Leu at position 27. These modifications reduce this compound&#39;s susceptibility to enzymatic breakdown, and increase its bioactivity.<span class="s33">4 </span><span class="s50">5 </span>Still, Mod GRF 1-29 has a short half-life, which usually necessitates administering the drug several times per day for optimal effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1971">Warnings:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Mod GRF 1-29 is an unapproved new drug.

Note that the incidence of GH-related side effects tends to be lower with GHRP therapy as compared to traditional hGH. This is because GH/IGF-1 release is subject to the limits of endogenous synthesis, and as such the drug is less amenable to overdosing.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1974">Side Effects (Injection site):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The subcutaneous administration of this drug may cause redness, itching, pain, or lumps at the site of injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1975">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Mod GRF 1-29 may be given by subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection, or IV infusion.

It  is  actually  a  variant  of endogenous hGH protein, containing the same sequence of 191 amino acids, but with the addition of an extra amino acid, methionine. For this reason somatrem is commonly described as methionyl human growth hormone. As an hGH medication, somatrem supports the growth of bone, skeletal muscle, connective tissues, and internal organs. It also plays a role in protein, carbohydrate, lipid, and mineral metabolism. In a medical setting, somatrem is used to treat children  with  growth  failure  caused  by  endogenous growth hormone deficiency. When administered as a long­ term treatment before linear growth is stopped due to closed epiphyses, the drug may impart a significant positive effect on linear growth. Somatrem is considered to be  therapeutically  equivalent  to  growth  hormone  of pituitary origin. As an hGH drug, somatrem is valued by bodybuilders and athletes for its ability to promote fat loss and muscle and connective tissue growth.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1979">Although somatrem is considered equivalent to human growth hormone, it is not a natural protein to the human body. This may increase the chance for developing antibodies  to  growth  hormone  during  treatment.  The antibodies work by binding with the growth hormone molecule, interfering with its ability to bind receptors and exert activity. In one clinical investigation, 2/3rd of the children treated with somatrem developed antibodies to growth hormone after one year.</a><span class="s50">1 </span>In a similarly configured investigation involving the administration of somatropin for one year, only 1 in 7 patients produced serum antibodies to growth hormone.<span class="s50">2 </span>It is important to note that in both studies the antibody reactions were not strong, and did not appear to substantially diminish the ability  of  the  drugs  to  be  therapeutically  effective. Diminishment activity (as determined by antibody levels) appears in an very small percentage (&lt;1%) of patients taking  somatrem.  Still,  the  correct  191  amino  acid configuration of somatropin is considered more desirable to use.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Somatrem was approved for sale in the U.S. in 1985. It was the first synthetic growth hormone medication available worldwide, produced via a manufacturing process called Inclusion  Body  Technology.<span class="s50">3  </span>The  technology  involves inserting the DNA encoding for the hGH protein into escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria, which assemble and synthesize the pure protein. Prior to the advent of synthetic growth hormone, hGH was made into a medication only by</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">extracting  the  natural  protein  from  human  corpses. Biological or cadaver hGH, as it was called, was banned in the U.S. in 1985 due to the high prevalence of a rare neurological disease in patients. Somatrem was approved for  sale  that  same  year,  giving  Genentech  a  short monopoly on the growth hormone market. Within several years, however, other biotechnology companies began selling a form of hGH that was identical to the endogenous protein, called somatropin. Although somatrem remains available in a number of markets including the United States, somatropin is much more widely distributed.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1980">How Supplied:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Somatrem is most commonly supplied in multi-dose vials containing  a  white  lyophilized  powder  that  requires reconstitution with sterile or bacteriostatic water before use.

The abuse of somatrem may cause diabetes, acromegaly (a visible  thickening of the bones, most notably the feet, forehead, hands, jaw, and elbows), and enlargement of the internal organs. Due to the growth promotion effects of human growth hormone, this drug should not be used by individuals with active or recurring cancer.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Impaired glucose tolerance):</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Somatrem may reduce sensitivity to insulin and raise blood sugar levels.

One milligram of somatrem is equivalent to approximately 3 International Units (3IU). When used to treat children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency, the drug is applied at a dosage up to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">.04/mg/kg per day.This equates to a maximum of roughly 1OIU per day for a person of approximately 180 lbs. A long­ term maintenance dosage is established after reviewing the patient&#39;s IGF-1 levels and clinical response over time, and may be substantially lower than 1 OIU.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1987">When  used  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes, somatrem is usually administered at a dosage between 1IU and 6 IU per day (2-4 IU being most common). The drug is commonly cycled in a similar manner to anabolic/androgenic steroids, with the length of intake generally being between 6 weeks and 24 weeks. The anabolic effects of this drug are less apparent than its lipolytic (fat loss) properties, and generally take longer periods of time and higher doses to manifest themselves.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Somatrem is available in the United States under the Protropin brand name which is distributed by Roche.

It is prescribed for the management of Type-ll diabetes, sometimes also referred to as mature onset diabetes since it tends to develop later in life. The drug is typically utilized when dietary management and exercise alone have not been able to control the progress of the disease, yet injectable insulin is not an appropriate option. While the main activity of metformin HCL is the increased utilization of glucose, it does not directly mimic the action of insulin. While its precise mode of action is unknown, it is understood to reduce the output of glucose by the liver, decrease the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increase insulin sensitivity in certain organs and peripheral tissues. Use of this agent will lower the patient&#39;s blood sugar, though its activity makes it less likely to cause a dangerous state  of  hypoglycemia  if  the  dosage  is  accidentally misjudged (a concern with injectable insulin).</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1990">Insulin manipulation is common in sports due to the biological actions of this hormone. Insulin is involved in nutrient storage, helping to transport amino acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates (glucose) into various cells. In the case of muscle cells, insulin also facilitates cellular anabolic (protein synthesizing) and anti-catabolic (protein sparing) actions. This hormone also directs nutrient storage to adipose cells, however, thus its manipulation has the potential to increase fat mass. Bodybuilders have found, however, that with intense weight training, insulin can show </a><i><b>a </b></i>much greater affinity for protein and carbohydrate storage in muscle cells. By manipulating insulin levels (or insulin sensitivity) under these conditions, muscle growth with minimal fat gain is possible. Injectable insulin can be risky however, as a mistake in dosage or carbohydrate intake  has  the  potential  to  cause  life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Since this effect is rare with metformin, it is considered by some athletes to be an introduction to insulin manipulation.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Metformin has a long and fairly complicated history in medicine. This drug was first synthesized in 1929 along with a series of other biguanides. Although some of its beneficial properties were elucidated at the time, it was not initially subject to human trials.&#39; It sat idle in the research books for nearly three decades after its creation. The first clinical study investigating its therapeutic potential as a glucose lowering medication was finally initiated in 1956.<span class="s50">2 </span>These trials were very successful, and metformin was selected for clinical development. It was given the trade name Glucophage, which translates to &quot;glucose eater’This,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">of course, refers to its ability to help the body dispose of blood glucose. Glucophage went on to be the most recognized trade name for metformin HCL. This trade name is still being used to market the drug today, presently by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Metformin was not initially the glucose-lowering agent of choice among clinicians. During the 1950s, it had been studied alongside phenformin and buformin, which had also  been  selected  for  commercial  development. Metformin was initially pushed aside in favor of these two drugs, both of which had proven to be significantly more potent at lowering blood sugar levels. These drugs would remain the dominant biguanides for approximately 20 years. By the 1970s, however, it was being reported that phenformin and buformin were producing unacceptably high incidences of lactic acidosis, an often-fatal metabolic disorder characterized by a rapid drop in pH. By the close <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">of </span>the 1970s, most governments had determined that these drugs were too risky to continue using. Phenformin and buformin  were  subsequently  removed  from  most pharmaceutical markets worldwide.</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1991">The structural and pharmacological similarity of metformin to phenformin and buformin held back its clinical potential for many years. Researchers were widely concerned that this agent would also present unfavorable risks. While lactic acidosis is a legitimate concern, it occurs much less frequently than with the other biguanides (approximately 1 in 33,000 patients). Following much evaluation of its benefit-risk  ratio,  metformin  eventually  came  to  be regarded as the safest drug of the biguanide class. It was widely pushed back into clinical medicine during the mid- 1990s. It was introduced to the United States in 1995, where it was an immediate success. In the years to follow, metformin continued to grab a stronger share of the global diabetes medication market. Today, it is estimated that metformin HCL is the most widely prescribed medication for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Metformin hydrochloride is most commonly supplied in</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">oral tablets of 500,850, and 1000 mg each.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1992">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1993">Metformin  is  a  synthetic  derivative  of  the  natural antidiabetic agent guanide.

This risk increases with conditions such as sepsis, dehydration, excess  alcohol  intake,  hepatic  insufficiency,  renal impairment,  and  acute  congestive  heart  failure. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include malaise, muscle pain, respiratory distress, drowsiness, and abdominal distress. Laboratory abnormalities include low pH, increased anion, and elevated blood lactate. If lactic acidosis is suspected, metformin HCL should be discontinued and the individual should seek immediate medical attention.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Common side effects of metformin HCL therapy include diarrhea (53.2%), nausea/vomiting (25.5%), flatulence</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: justify;">(12.1%), weakness (9.2%), indigestion (7.1%), abdominal</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">discomfort  (6.4%),  and  headache  (5.7%).<span class="s33">3  </span>Metformin must  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  renal dysfunction, and impaired creatinine clearance.

Hypoglycemia is uncommon with the use of metformin,  though  is  sometimes  noted when  caloric intake is deficient, or when strenuous exercise is not compensated  by  caloric  supplementation.  Minor  side effects often subside over time, or with use of a lower metformin HCL dosage.

Extended release (XR) formulations are also made, which further delay the absorption of metformin HCL. Extended release tablets should be taken whole, and not crushed. In a clinical setting, the drug is given in divided doses with meals, except for extended release formulations, which are administered once daily with the evening meal.There is no set adult clinical dose, and the drug must be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. It is typically initiated at a low daily dosage,</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">and slowly escalated by 500 mg each week or 850 mg every two weeks until the minimum daily dose required for adequate glycemic control has been established. The maximum recommended daily dose for type-2 diabetic patients in 2550 mg per day. Fasting plasma glucose is used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin HCL, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels are measured every three months. The goal of therapy is to decrease fasting  plasma  glucose  and  glycosylated  hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal levels using the lowest effective dose of metformin HCL, either alone or in combination  with  another  antihyperglycemic  drug (sulfonylurea or insulin).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When  used  for  physique  or  performance-enhancing purposes, the typical protocol is to take 850 mg once or twice per day. If a single application is desired, it is typically taken 1-2 hours before exercise, so that the drug can have its peak effect during the early stages of recovery. It is highly common to utilize a carbohydrate supplement during  the  hours  metformin  is  active  in  the  body, especially during the crucial 2-3 hour &quot;nutrient uptake&quot; window  following  intense  training.  The  result  of metformin treatment is typically not as dramatic as insulin, but the drug still does have a notable anabolic effect for many users. Most bodybuilders/athletes opt to use this drug for a limited duration, with cycles lasting 6-8 weeks in length. This would be followed by an equally long break (at a minimum) before metformin, insulin, or any other antihyperglycemic agent is used for physique or performance-enhancing purposes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1996">Availability Trends:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Metformin is readily available given its widespread use in clinical medicine. It is sold under many brand names, as both  a  standalone  and  combination  medication. Bodybuilders and athletes tend to limit their use to preparations containing only metformin. While the drug is not the subject of much interest by steroid counterfeiting or underground manufacturing operations, it is the target of many other general drug counterfeits given the ease in which it can be sold. As such, it should not be assumed that all packaged drug products labeled as metformin are legitimate. Care should be taken to ensure that ail products bearing this ingredient have been acquired through legitimate pharmaceutical channels.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s68" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 4pt;text-align: left;">1 <span class="s67">Metformin: its botanical background.

Th is, however, is an activity of insulin that can be somewhat managed by the user. Athletes have found that a strict regimen of intense weight training and a diet without excess caloric and fat intake can enable insulin to show a much higher affinity for protein and glucose storage in muscle (as opposed to fatty acid storage in adipose) cells. This is especially true in the post-exercise enhanced-absorptive state, where insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle has been shown to increase significantly over baseline (rested) levels.<span class="s33">4 </span>When used during the post-training window, the hormone is, likewise, capable of producing rapid and noticeable muscle gains.The muscles often begin to look fuller (and even sometimes more defined) very soon after initiating insulin therapy, and the overall results of therapy are often described as dramatic.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The fact that insulin use cannot be detected by urinalysis has ensured it a place in the drug regimens of many athletes and professional bodybuilders. Note that there has been some progress in drug detection, especially with the analogs, but to date regular insulin is still considered a &quot;safe&quot;drug. Insulin is often used in combination with other &quot;contest safe&quot; drugs like human growth hormone, thyroid medications, and low dose testosterone injections, and together can have a dramatic effect on the user&#39;s physique and performance without fear of a positive urinalysis result.Those who do not have to worry about drug testing, however,  often  find  that  insulin  combined  with</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">anabolic/androgenic steroids can be a very synergistic combination. This is because the two actively support an anabolic  state  through  different  mechanisms.  Insulin strongly enhances the transport of nutrients into muscle cells and inhibits protein breakdown, and the anabolic steroids (among other things) strongly increase the rate of protein synthesis.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1998">As mentioned, the usual medical purpose for insulin is to treat different forms of diabetes. More specifically, the human body may not be producing enough insulin (Type- I diabetes), or may not recognize insulin well at the cell site although some level is present in the blood (Type-ll diabetes).Type-1 diabetics are, therefore, required to inject insulin on a regular basis, as they are left without a sufficient level of this hormone. Along with medication, the individual will need to constantly monitor blood glucose levels and regulate their sugar intake. Together with lifestyle  modifications  such  as  regular  exercise  and developing a balanced diet, insulin dependent individuals can live a healthy and full life. When left untreated, however, diabetes can be a fatal disease.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Insulin first became available as a medicine during the 1920s. Credit for the discovery is most appropriately given to  Canadian  physician  Fred  Banting  and  Canadian physiologist  Charles  Best,  who  worked  together  to produce the first insulin preparations, and the world&#39;s first effective treatment of diabetes.Their work stemmed from an idea initially proposed by Banting, who as a young doctor theorized that an active extract could be made from animal pancreases to regulate blood sugar in human patients. He needed help to try and actualize his idea, and he sought out world-renowned physiologist J J.R. Macleod at the University of Toronto. Macleod, initially less than impressed with the unusual concept (but likely impressed with Banting&#39;s conviction and tenacity), assigned a couple of graduate students to assist him in his work. A coin flip determined who would work with Banting, and he was eventually paired with graduate student Best. Together they made medical history.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first insulin preparations they produced were made of crude pancreatic extracts taken from dogs. At one point the supply of laboratory animals was exhausted, and desperate to continue their research, the pair actually began taking stray dogs to supplement their pancreas supply. Shortly after, the two found that they could work with the pancreases of slaughtered cows and pigs, making their work much easier (and ethically acceptable). They successfully treated their first diabetic patient with insulin</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">in January 1922. By August of that year, they had been successful in treating a group of clinical patients, including 15-year-old  Elizabeth  Hughes,  daughter  of  former presidential candidate Charles Evans Hughes. Elizabeth was diagnosed with diabetes in 1918, and her dramatic fight for life with the disease gained national attention. Elizabeth would be saved by insulin on the doorstep of starvation, as severe calorie restriction was the only remedy known to slow the disease at the time. Banting and Macleod  swiftly won the Nobel Prize for their discovery, which was presented to them approximately a year later in 1923. Shortly after, dispute over credit arose, and ultimately Banting shared his prize with Best, and Macleod shared his prize with J. B. Collip, a chemist that assisted in the extraction and purification process.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">After initially declining the assistance in the hopes that they could work out production issues on their own, Banting and his team worked with Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to develop the first mass-produced insulin medicines using their animal extraction techniques. Their production success was  extreme  and  rapid,  and  the  drug  became commercially available on a wide scale in 1923, the same year Banting and Macleod won the Nobel prize.That same year, Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Danish scientist Augusta Krogh, who desperately wanted to bring back an insulin manufacturing technique to Denmark to treat his wife, who was ill with diabetes.This Denmark firm eventually became Novo Nordisk, the world&#39;s second leading producer of insulin next to Eli Lilly <i><b>&amp; Co.</b></i></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The early insulin medications were fairly impure by today&#39;s standards. They typically contained 40 units of animal insulin per milliliter, in contrast to today&#39;s accepted standard concentration of 100 units. The large doses needed with these early low-concentration drugs were not  very  comfortable  for  patients,  and  injection-site reactions were not uncommon. They also contained significant  protein  impurities  that  would  sometimes cause allergic reactions in users. Despite these faults, the drugs  saved  the  lives  of  countless  individuals  who beforehand were faced with a sure death sentence following a diagnosis of diabetes. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk improved the purity of their products in the coming years, but no major improvements in insulin technology developed until the mid-1930s, when the first longer-acting insulin preparations began to surface.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The first longer-acting drug made use of protamine and zinc to delay the action of insulin in the body, extending the activity curve and reducing the number of daily injections required for many patients. Dubbed Protamine Zinc Insulin (PZI), the preparation would have an effect lasting  as  long  as  24-36  hours.  Neutral  Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) Insulin, also known as Isophane insulin.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">followed, reaching market by 1950. This preparatic /as very similar to PZI insulin except that it could be mixed with regular insulin without disturbing the release curve of the respective insulins. In other words, a regular insulin drug could be mixed in the same syringe with NPH insulin, providing a biphasic release pattern characterized by an early peak effect due to the regular insulin, and an extended action brought on by the NPH.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 1951 the Lente insulins began to surface, which included semilente, lente, and ultra-lente preparations. The amount of zinc used in each varied, producing preparations   with   distinct   and   long-acting pharmacokinetics. Unlike previous Insulins, this was also achieved without the use of protamine. Many physicians were soon able to successfully switch their patients from NPH insulin over to a single morning dose of Lente insulin, often heralding the release of the new drugs as a big advance in insulin medications (though some would still require an evening dose with a Lente insulin to maintain full control over blood glucose levels during the 24-hour period). Up to this point the insulin drugs made by the large pharmaceutical companies worked very well. No substantial step forward in the development of new insulin delivery technologies would come for another 23 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In 1974, chromatographic purification techniques allowed the manufacture of animal insulin with extremely low impurity levels (less than 1 pmol/l of protein impurities). Novo was the first to release a drug made with this technology, which it called monocomponent (MC) Insulin. Eli Lilly also released a version called &quot;Single Peak&quot; Insulin, likely referring to the single protein peak noticed upon chemical analysis.This advance, though significant, would be short lived. In 1975, Ciba-Geigy produced the first synthetic insulin preparation (CGP 12831). And just three years later, scientists at Genentech were able to produce insulin using modified E. coli bacteria, the first synthetic insulin with an identical amino acid sequence as human insulin (although the animal insulins work fine in humans their structures are slightly different). The U.S. Food and Drug administration approved the first such medicines in 1982, with the acceptance of Humulin R (Regular) and Humulin NPH from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. The name Humulin is a contraction of the words &quot;human&quot; and &quot;insulin” of course. Novo would follow with semi-synthetic insulins Actrapid HM and Monotard HM.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The FDA has approved a variety of other insulin drug combinations over the years, including various biphasic insulin blends that use differing amounts of rapid and longer-acting insulins. More recently, we have also seen the FDA approval of Eli Lilly&#39;s rapid-acting insulin analog Humalog. Several other analogs are also now available</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1999">including Lantus and Apidra from Aventis, and Levemir and  Novorapid  from  Novo  Nordisk.  A  number  of additional analogs are also under investigation at this time.  With  the  large  variety  of  different  insulin medications approved and sold in the U.S. and other nations,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  &quot;insulin&quot; represents an extremely broad class of medicines. As a class, these drugs are likely to continue to expand as new agents are developed and successfully tested. Today, it is estimated that 55 million people use some form of injectable insulin on a regular basis to manage their diabetes,  making  this  an  extremely  important  and lucrative area of human medicine.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Pharmaceutical insulin comes from one of two basic origins, animal or synthetic. With animal source insulin, the hormone is extracted from the pancreas of either pigs or cows (or both) and prepared for medical use. These preparations  are  further  divided  into  the  categories &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;purified? dependent on the level of purity and  non-insulin  content  of  the  solution.  With  such products there is always the slight possibility of pancreatic contaminants making their way into the prepared drug. Specifically  called  biosynthetic,  synthetic  insulin  is produced by a recombinant DNA procedure similar to the process used to manufacture human growth hormone. The result is a polypeptide hormone consisting of one 21- amino acid &quot;A-chain&quot;coupled by two disulfide bonds with one 30-amino acid &quot;B-chain&#39;.’The biosynthetic process will produce  a  drug  free  of  the  pancreatic  protein contaminants possible with animal insulin, and that is structurally  and  biologically  identical  to  human pancreatic  insulin.  With  the  innate  (remote)  risk  of contamination involved with animal insulin, coupled with the fact that the structure is (very slightly) different from human insulin, synthetic human insulin drugs dominate the  market  today.  Biosynthetic  human  insulin/insulin analogs are also the most common insulins of use among athletes, and the main focus of this profile.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">There are a variety of synthetic insulins available, with each possessing unique properties relating to speed of onset, peak and duration of activity, and concentration of dose. This therapeutic variety may allow physicians to tailor  a  treatment  program  for  insulin-dependant diabetics that  allows for the least amount  of daily injections and the greatest level of patient comfort. It is important that one should be aware of the individual activity of any insulin drug before attempting its use. Due to  the  differences  between  preparations,  it  is  also medically advised that extreme care be taken whenever a physician  attempts  to  switch  an  insulin-dependant diabetic patient from one form of insulin medication to</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">another.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Below is a list showing the distinctions between popular forms of biosynthetic insulin.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2000">Short-acting Insulins:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><i><b>Humalog- (Insulin Lispro): </b></i>Humalog® is a short-acting analog of human insulin, specifically the Lys(B28) Pro(B29) analog of insulin created when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 are reversed. It is considered equipotent to regular soluble insulin on a unit-to-unit basis, but with more rapid activity.<span class="s33">5 </span>The onset of drug action  following  subcutaneous  administration  is approximately 15 minutes, and its peak effect is reached in 30 to 90 minutes.

These are identified as &quot;U-100&quot; preparations in the U.S.and many other regions. In addition to this, however, there are also concentrated forms of insulin available for patients that require  higher  doses  and  a  more  economical  or comfortable option to U-100 preparations. In the U.S., products containing as much as 5 times the normal concentration, or 500 IU per milliliter, are also sold.These are identified as &quot;U-500&quot; preparations, and are available by prescription only. It can be extremely dangerous or life threatening to replace a U-100 insulin product with a U-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">500  product  without  making  the  necessary  dosing adjustments  to  compensate  for  the  greater  drug concentration. Given the general difficulty in accurately measuring athletic doses (2-15 IU) with a drug of such high concentration, U-100 preparations are used almost exclusively  for  physique-  and  performance-enhancing purposes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Hypoglycemia):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Hypoglycemia is the primary danger with the use of insulin. This is a dangerous condition that occurs when blood glucose levels fall too low. It is a common and potentially fatal reaction experienced at some time or another by most medical and nonmedical insulin users, so it needs to be taken seriously. It is, therefore, critical to understand the warning signs of hypoglycemia. The following is a list of symptoms that may indicate mild to moderate  hypoglycemia:  hunger,  drowsiness,  blurred vision, depressive mood, dizziness, sweating, palpitation, tremor, restlessness, tingling in the hands, feet, lips, or tongue,  lightheadedness,  inability  to  concentrate, headache, sleep disturbances, anxiety, slurred speech, irritability, abnormal behavior, unsteady movement, and personality changes. If any of these warning signs should occur, one should immediately consume a food or drink containing  simple  sugars  such  as  a  candy  bar  or carbohydrate drink.This will hopefully raise blood glucose levels sufficiently enough to ward off mild to moderate hypoglycemia. There is always a possibility of severe hypoglycemia,  which  is  very  serious  and  requires immediate emergency medical attention. Symptoms of this include disorientation, seizure, unconsciousness, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">death. Note that in some cases the symptoms of hypoglycemia are mistaken for drunkenness.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is also very important to note that you may notice a tendency to get sleepy after injecting insulin. This is an early symptom of hypoglycemia, and a clear sign the user should be consuming more carbohydrates. One should absolutely avoid the temptation to go to sleep at this point, as the insulin may take its peak effect during rest, and  blood  glucose  levels  could  be  left  to  drop significantly. Unaware of this condition during sleep, the athlete may be at a high risk for going into a state of severe hypoglycemia.The serious dangers of such a <span style=" color: #393939;">state </span>have  already  been  discussed,  and  unfortunately consuming more carbohydrates during sleep will not be an  option.  Those  experimenting  with  insulin  would, therefore, be wise to always stay awake for the duration of the drug&#39;s effect, and also avoid using insulin in the early evening to ensure the drug will not be inadvertently active when retiring for the night. It is also important to make sure others are aware of your use of the drug so that they may inform emergency medical technicians should you lose consciousness or the ability to inform others of your condition due to hypoglycemia.This information can spare valuable (perhaps life saving) time in helping medical professionals establish a diagnosis and provide supportive treatment.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects (Lipodystrophy):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The subcutaneous administration of insulin may cause a localized increase in adipose tissue at the site of injection. This may be compounded by the repeated administration of insulin at the same site of injection.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2003">Side Effects (Allergy to Insulin):</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2004">In a small percentage of users, the administration of insulin may cause a localized allergy. This may include irritation, swelling, itching, and/or redness at the site of injection. This often subsides as therapy continues. In some instances it may be due to an allergy </a><span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>an ingredient, or in the case of animal insulin, a protein contaminant. Less common, but potentially more serious, is a systemic allergic reaction to insulin administration. This may include a rash on the whole body, wheezing, shortness  of  breath,  fast  pulse,  sweating,  and/or  a reduction in blood pressure. In rare instances this may be life threatening. Any adverse reaction should be reported to a medical authority.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration (General):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Given that there are varying forms of insulin available for medical use with differing pharmacokinetic patterns, as well as products with different drug concentrations, it is extremely important that the user be familiar with the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2005">dosage and actions of any specific insulin preparation they intend to use so that peak-effect, total time of effect, total dosage, and carbohydrate intake can be closely monitored. Rapid-acting insulin preparations (Novolog, Humalog, and Humulin-R) are the most popular choices for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes, and the subject of the dosing information presented in this book. It is also important to stress that before one considers using insulin they should also become very familiar with using a glucometer. This is a medical device that can give you a quick and accurate reading of your blood glucose level. This device can be indispensable in helping   one   manage   and   optimize   their insulin/carbohydrate intake.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Administration (Short-acting Insulin):</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Short  acting  forms  of  insulin  (Novolog,  Humalog, Humulin-R)  are  designed  for  subcutaneous  injection. Following  subcutaneous  injection,  the  injection  site should be left alone and not rubbed, to prevent the drug from releasing into circulation too quickly. It is also advised to rotate subcutaneous injection sites regularly to avoid the localized buildup of subcutaneous fat that may develop due to the lipogenic properties of this hormone (see Adverse Reactions; Lipodystrophy). The medical dosage  will  vary  depending  on  the  individual requirements of the patient.Furthermore,changesinsuch things as diet, activity level, or work/sleep schedule may affect  the  required  insulin  dose.  Although  not recommended medically, it is possible to administer some short-acting  insulins  via  intramuscular  injection.  This, however, may create more variability (and potential risk) with regard to drug dissipation and hypoglycemic effect.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Insulin dosages can vary slightly among athletes, and are often dependent upon factors like body weight, insulin sensitivity, activity level, diet, and the use of other drugs. Most users choose to administer insulin immediately after a workout, which is the most opportunistic time of the day to use this drug. Among bodybuilders, dosages of regular insulin (Humulin-R) used are usually in the range of 11ll per 15-20 pounds of lean bodyweight; 10IU is perhaps the most common dosage. This amount may be adjusted downward slightly for users of the more rapid-acting Humalog and Novolog preparations, which provide a higher and faster peak effect. First-time cautious users usually ignore bodyweight guidelines, and instead start at a low dosage with the intention of gradually working up to a normal dosage. For example, on the first day of insulin therapy one may begin with a dose as low as 2 IU. Each consecutive post-workout application this dosage might be  increased  by  1IU,  until  the  user  determines  a comfortable range. Many feel this is safer and much more tailored to the individual than simply calculating and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">injecting a dose, as some find they tolerate slightly more or less insulin than weight guidelines would dictate. Athletes using growth hormone in particular often have slightly higher insulin requirements, as HGH therapy is shown to both lower secretion of, and induce cellular resistance to, insulin.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark2006">One must also remember that it is very important to consume  carbohydrates  for  several  hours  following insulin use. One should generally follow the rule-of-thumb of ingesting at least 10-15 grams of simple carbohydrates per IU of insulin injected (with a minimum immediate intake of 100 grams regardless of dose).This is timed </a><span style=" color: #393939;">1</span>0 to 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection of Humulin-R, or immediately after using Novolog or Humalog.The use of a carbohydrate replacement drink is often used as a fast carbohydrate source. Properly cautious insulin users will always have a source for simple sugars on-hand in case an unexpected drop in glucose levels is noticed. Many athletes will also take creatine monohydrate with their carbohydrate drink, since the insulin may help force more creatine into the muscles. 30-60 minutes after injecting insulin, one should also eat a good meal and consume a protein shake. The carbohydrate drink and meal/protein shake are absolutely necessary, as without them blood sugar levels may drop dangerously low and the athlete may  enter  a  state  of  hypoglycemia  (see  Adverse Reactions: Hypoglycemia). Carbohydrates and proteins are continually provided in sufficient amounts to meet glucose requirements throughout the entire window of insulin effect.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Administration (Intermediate-acting, Long-acting,<span class="s5"> </span>and Biphasic Insulins):</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Intermediate-acting, long-acting, and biphasic insulins are designed  for  subcutaneous  injection.  Intramuscular injection will cause the drug to be released too rapidly, potentially  resulting  in  hypoglycemia.  Following subcutaneous injection, the injection site should be left alone and not rubbed, to prevent the drug from releasing into circulation too quickly. <span style=" color: #393939;">It </span>is also advised to rotate subcutaneous  injection  sites  regularly  to  avoid  the localized  buildup  of  subcutaneous  fat  due  to  the lipogenic  properties  of  this  hormone  (see  Adverse Reactions: Lipodystrophy). The medical dosage will vary depending on the individual requirements of the patient. Furthermore, changes in such things as diet, activity level, or work/sleep schedule may affect the required insulin dose.  Intermediate-acting,  long-acting,  and  biphasic insulins  are  not  widely  used  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing  purposes  due  to  their  longer acting  nature,  which  makes  them  poorly  suited  for concentrating the nutrient partitioning effect of insulin during the short post-workout enhanced-nutrient-uptake</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2007">window.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">U-1OO insulins may be dispensed from pharmacies in the United States without a prescription. This is so that an insulin-dependent diabetic will have easy access to this life-saving medication. Concentrated (U-500) insulin is sold by prescription only.

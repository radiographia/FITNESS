It  also  has  the  same pharmacological   action   as   recombinant   human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa). In the body, erythropoietin is normally released by the kidneys in response to hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels). This in turn triggers bone marrow to increase red blood cell production. As such, this hormone is vital to the regulation of normal red blood cell concentrations in humans. With a similar mode of action to recombinant erythropoietin, darbepoetin alfa can be used to  augment  erythropoiesis  when  the  body  is  not maintaining adequate red blood cell levels on its own. It is FDA approved for the treatment of anemia (low red blood cell  count)  associated  with  chronic  renal  failure  or chemotherapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Darbepoetin  alfa  differs  from  recombinant  human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) mainly in its duration of activity. This new protein maintains its levels in the blood for approximately three times longer, causing it to have a much longer therapeutic window. This means that with darbepoetin alfa patients are required to administer the product much less frequently than they would epoetin alfa. While epoetin alfa is usually injected on a schedule of three times per week, darbepoetin alfa requires only one injection in the same time frame.This may enhance patient comfort  considerably,  especially  when  the  patient  is visiting the physician for routine drug administration.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Endurance athletes are highly attracted to darbepoetin alfa for the effect it has on red blood cell production. It is no secret that the practice of blood doping has been popular with endurance sports. This procedure involves removing, concentrating, and storing a quantity of red blood cells from your own body to be transfused later. By adding the stored cells before an event (by then the body has restored the lost blood volume), the athlete has a much greater concentration  of  red  blood  cells.  The  blood  should, likewise, transport oxygen more efficiently, and the athlete may  be  given  a  significant  endurance  boost.  This procedure can be quite risky, however, as blood products can  be  difficult  to  store  and  administer  correctly. Darbepoetin alfa is a drug that basically equates to chemical blood doping, and can achieve the same end result (higher red cell concentrations) with the use of a simple medication.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1726">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Darbeopetin alfa was developed as a prescription drug by Amgen.The U.S.Food &amp; Drug Administration first approved</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">it  for  sale  in  2001.  Amgen  is  the  world&#39;s  largest biotechnologies company, and the same firm that first brought recombinant erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) to the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">U.S. market in 1984. The main focus with darbepoetin alfa appears to have been the development of a much longer acting erythropoietic protein in comparison to their earlier recombinant erythropoietin, which is commonly injected on a schedule of three times per week. The prescribing guidelines for darbepoetin alfa recommend a once per week schedule, which seems to offer strong comfort advantages to epoetin alfa for patients that do not like receiving frequent injections. Darbepoetin alfa has not yet reached the level of market success that has been noted with epoetin alfa preparations, but has been a strong selling drug for Amgen ever since its release.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1727">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1728">Darbepoetin alfa is most commonly found in single-dose vials and prefilled syringes containing 25,40, 60,100,150, 200,300, or 500 mcg of drug.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Darbepoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid protein that differs from human erythropoietin by the substitution of amino acids  on  the  erythropoietin peptide  backbone,  which allows  the  addition  of  two  additional  N-linked oligosaccharide chains.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Warnings (Death, Viral Disease):</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The  misuse  of  darbepoetin  alfa  for  physique-  or performance-enhancing purposes is characterized as a high-risk practice.

The recommended starting dose for the treatment of anemia in adult CRF patients is .45 mcg/kg body weight, administered once per week as a single IV or SC injection. The dosage is subsequently adjusted based on  changes  in  hematocrit.  Healthy  athletes  using darbepoetin  alfa  for  performance-enhancing  purposes generally start on the very low end of the therapeutic spectrum, and adjust according to changes in hematocrit. This may entail initiating therapy with as little as .05 mcg/kg of body weight once per week. Note that it is considered very important to monitor blood cell counts closely during the entire intake of darbepoetin alfa to help ensure hematocrit is not allowed to increase to an unhealthy level.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 37pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1731">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Darbepoetin alfa is not widely sold on the black market.

Counterfeit drugs  of  this  class  have  even  infiltrated  legitimate pharmaceutical  distribution  channels,  suggesting  that care should be taken when purchasing this and similar drug products.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Epogen® (epoetin al fa)</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1732">Description:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that is produced in the kidneys, and is responsible for stimulating red blood cell production. Epoetin alfa is a pharmaceutical form of erythropoietin,   which   was   manufactured   using recombinant DNA technology.The compound is produced from animal cells into which the gene coding for human erythropoietin has been inserted. The biological activity and structure of epoetin alfa are indistinguishable from that of human erythropoietin. Epoetin alfa is used to treat many  forms  of  anemia,  effectively  stimulating  and maintaining  erythropoiesis  in  a  large  percentage  of patients treated. The efficiency of this drug quickly made it a ready replacement for older (less effective) therapies such as Anadrol 50®.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1733">Endurance athletes are highly attracted to epoetin alfa for the effect it has on red blood cell production.

Epoetin alfa marked the development  of  the  first  drug  that  specifically  and effectively stimulated the process of erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). Its success was rapid and far reaching. Epoetin alfa has since been introduced to a wide number of different countries. The most popular trade names include Procrit (distributed by Ortho, manufactured by Amgen), Epogen (Amgen), and Eprex (Johnson &amp; Johnson). In addition to these, more than one dozen other trade names are also used to market epoetin alfa.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1734">In 2002 the subcutaneous use of Eprex, which is sold only outside the United States, was linked to a rare disease called pure red-cell aplasia. This is a condition where the body loses its ability to produce red blood cells.Those that suffer  from  pure  red-cell  aplasia  usually  become dependant on continual blood transfusions for survival. Close to 200 people taking Eprex were identified as developing this rare condition, far in excess of normal expected numbers. Internal investigations by Johnson &amp; Johnson linked the high numbers to changes in the product that were made to satisfy European regulations limiting the use of albumin. According to a company spokesperson,  a chemical reaction between the new stabilizer that replaced albumin and the rubber stopper allowed organic compounds to leech into the vials. The company subsequently replaced its original stoppers with coated rubber to prevent this reaction. The incidence of pure-red cell anemia in patients receiving erythropoietin seems to have been reduced as a result, although warnings about this reaction remain on the prescribing information for all products sold in the U.S.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Epoetin alfa is supplied as a dry sterile powder that requires reconstitution with sterile diluent before injection.

It is manufactured in Latvia under the commercial name of Mildronate and is one of the countries largest exports, with turnover reaching EUR 65 million in 2013 according to reports. This drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Meldonium  is  a  structural  analogue  of the carnitine precursor,  gamma-butyrobetaine.  Carnitine  is  a  key regulator of fat metabolism, since it is required to transport fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for fatty acid breakdown. Carnitine binds to the fatty acid chains to form acylcarnitine, which can then cross the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Meldonium  affects  carnitine  metabolism  by  inhibiting gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of gammabutyrobetaine to carnitine. There is also evidence to suggest that meldonium inhibits the organic cation transporter-2 (OCTN2) (Dambrova et al, 2016) The function of OCTN2 is to maintain the tissue concentrations of organic cations, such as carnitine.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">Together, inhibition of butyrobetaine hydroxylase and of OCTN2, decreases the tissue concentration of carnitine and increases its concentration in the urine.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The lowering of carnitine levels has two effects;(1) a shift of cell metabolism from highly oxygen-consuming fatty-acid oxidation to increased glucose oxidation and increased ATP generation per molecule of oxygen and (2), protection of mitochondria from an overload of fatty acid metabolites. Meldonium also increases gene expression related to glucose metabolism and thereby also directly stimulates the oxidation of glucose (Liepnish et al. 2008).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1741">The increase in ATP generated per molecule of oxygen consumed  could  be  of  huge  benefit  under  hypoxic conditions. The most apparent benefits have so far been seen in the treatment of ischemic heart disease, but it is suggested that meldonium could be equally beneficial under the low oxygen conditions experienced during intense exercise.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Meldonium was initially developed in the mid-1970s for veterinary  applications,  due  to  proposed  growth­ promoting effects in animals, at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis. It was designed by the Latvian chemist Ivars Kalvinsh, with the aim of inhibiting carnitine</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">biosynthesis and preventing the accumulation of cytotoxic intermediates of fatty acid beta-oxidation. This function was then also noted to have a beneficial effect in ischemic tissues, where it blocks the highly oxygen-consuming process of beta-oxidation.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The main application of meldonium was initially as a treatment for myocardial ischemia, and this is still a widespread  use  for  the  drug.  Meldonium  has  been clinically trialed for use in the treatment of myocardial ischemia and it was shown to improve ventricular systolic function,  inhibit  myocardial  hypertrophy  and  dilation, increase peripheral blood circulation, improve exercise tolerance and ultimately improve patients&#39; quality of life (Schobersberger et al, 2016).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Nowadays, meldonium is also prescribed in neurological clinics  for  its  reported  beneficial  effect  on  cerebral circulatory disorders and CNS functions (N. Sjakste et al, 2005).That said, the clinical evidence that meldonium can improve neurological outcomes after ischemic brain injury is, at present, minimal.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In some reports, meldonium also appears to improve mood in patients; they reported as becoming more active, and have decreased motor dysfunction, asthenia, dizziness and nausea (Enina et al, 1991). in some eastern European countries, meldonium is therefore also recommended for improvement of reduced work capacity, as well as for physical  and  psycho-emotional  overexertion  and alcoholism.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Even more recently, meldonium has been widely used by elite athletes across a range of sports. For example, at the Baku 2015 European games, meldonium was found in 8.7% of all urine samples collected, and its use was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports (Stuart et al, 2016).The drug was used by athletes competing in both power-based and endurance-based sports.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The evidence supporting the use of meldonium as a performance-enhancing drug is limited. The theory is that as exercise intensity increases, we shift our metabolism</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">away  from  fat  oxidation  and  towards  carbohydrate oxidation (Romijn etal, 1995). L-carnitine is suggested to be the main regulator of fat oxidation in the transition from moderate to higher exercise intensities (Jeppesen et al, 2012). In principle, the effect of meldonium on carnitine may  therefore  allow  the  oxygen-sparing  shift  in metabolism to occur sooner, thereby improving exercise performance.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1742">The one study investigating the effects of meldonium in sports people reported increased physical capacity in trained judokas (Kakhabrishvili et al, 2002). However, that study has an unreliable methodology, with a low number of participants, no clear validation of exercise tests and no statistical tests.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The clinically suggested dose is 500mg twice a day. The main manufacturer, Grindeks, a Latvian pharmaceutical company, sells the drug in capsule form. Meldonium is not approved by the FDA in the United States but it is registered and widely prescribed in Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1743">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1744">Meldonium is a structural analogue of the carnitine precursor,  A-butyrobetaine,  with  an  amino  group replacing the C4 methylene on A-butyrobetaine.

The vast majority of human studies have focused on the effects of meldonium on patients with chronic coronary heart disease or diabetes.The effects of the drug in healthy subjects is thus unknown.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Drug labels from countries where meldonium is sold list side  effects  including  increased  blood  pressure, tachycardia,   and   indigestion.   Another   Latvian manufacturer  of  the  product  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">-  </span>OlainFarm  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">-  </span>lists headaches, agitation and skin irritation as side effects.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The toxicology of meldonium has been studied in various animal  models.  One  study  showed  no  changes  in hematopoiesis, functional state of liver and kidneys, or any alterations in tissue structure of the inner organs after repeated oral daily administration of the drug for 6 months, in mice (Petersone et al, 1991).

It is FDA approved for the treatment of narcolepsy  (a  disorder  characterized  by  sudden and uncontrollable attacks of deep sleep, mental fatigue, or excessive sleepiness), sleep apnea, and SWSD (Shift Work Sleep Disorder). It is being investigated for a number of other uses, including the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, depression,  and  attention  deficit  disorder.  Modafinil belongs to a group of drugs known as Eugeroics (&quot;good arousal&quot;), designed to promote a mental state of vigilance and alertness. One of its known mechanisms is to work as an alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, exerting its mood and energy enhancing effects through the increased release of dopamine in the CNS. It also results in alterations in local GABA and glutamate levels.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of modafinil as a stimulant has been shown in studies to have many advantages over amphetamines. To begin with, it is believed to have a much lower potential for abuse due to the fact that it produces a lower sense of euphoria. It also displays lower peripheral CNS stimulation (less side effects), has minimal effects on blood pressure, produces no interruptions in normal sleeping patterns (no hangover or needing &quot;catch-up&quot; sleep), and has an overall greater safety profile according to clinical trials.This drug is of interest even to the U.S. military, which is looking at it as an energy enhancer for pilots and combat soldiers that need to operate for long periods of time without sleep.This is not as unusual as it may seem at first, as military combat pilots and soldiers have used Dexedrine (an amphetamine) extensively in the past when sleep was inconvenient. Soldiers on modafinil often report that they maintain excellent cognitive functioning for up to 40 hours without sleep,  and  have  fewer  side  effects  than  Dexedrine. Modafinil has been tested in recent combat situations such as in Afghanistan and Iraq, and seems poised for official acceptance as a battlefield drug.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Recently, modafinil has become a popular drug among competitive athletes. They use it not simply to &quot;stay awake&quot; but  as  a  performance  enhancing  agent  with  both stimulant and endurance-increasing properties. This type of use probably comes as a surprise to those who developed this drug, as early reports suggested that this was a &quot;mild&quot; alertness drug, without strong stimulant properties  that  would  improve  athletic  performance. Recent studies contradict this determination. A study conducted in Canada shows a very strong athletic benefit inherent in modafinil.<span class="s33">1 </span>During this double-blind</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">investigation, a dose of 4 mg per kg of bodyweight (this equates to 200 mg for a 2201b man) of modafinil, or placebo, was given to a group of 15 male volunteers.Three hours after ingestion, aerobic exercise was conducted on a cycle  ergometer  at  85%  V02max  (maximum  aerobic power), and the amount of time until exhaustion was determined. While taking modafinil, the men were able to exercise for significantly longer periods of time (-30%), and had greater oxygen intake at exertion. They also reported lower subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), which suggests that the increased performance was in part due to a significantly less pronounced sensation of fatigue during exercise.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1747">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Modafinil was developed by Lafon Laboratories in France. It was approved for sale in the United States by the FDA in 1998, where it was introduced under the Provigil® brand name. Modafinil is also found internationally under this and several additional trade names including Modiodal®, Vigil®, Alertec®, and Modasomil®. Although the drug appears to have a favorable safety record and profile, it was quickly considered a d rug of potential abuse in the U.S. It is presently classified as a schedule IV controlled substance, which places modafinil in the same category as Valium and Xanax.This is intended to limit its diversion for nonmedical purposes by placing considerable legal penalties on its possession and importation. The medical applications for the drug are fairly broad, however, including SWSD, which refers to sleep disturbances caused by changing- or late- shift  work.  Prescriptions  for  the  drug  are,  likewise, commonly  granted  by  physicians  in  general  medical practice.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Modafinil  quietly  became  popular  among  competitive athletes between 2000 and 2004, before the athletic bodies were aware of the drug. Its use as a performance­ enhancing agent was revealed to the public during the designer steroid (BALCO) doping scandal of 2004, however, when it was disclosed that many of the same athletes who tested positive forTHG also used modafinil.The IOC quickly</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1748">banned its use, and with the help of a number of researchers a methodology for detecting this chemical in the urine was developed.This test is now implemented as part  of  the  standard  Olympic  level  drug  screening process. Most of the other international athletic bodies have followed the IOC&#39;s lead in banning and testing for modafinil. The drug has since lost all appeal as an &quot;invisible&quot; performance-enhancing agent, although is still being used by many athletes that are not subject to random urine testing.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1749">Modafinil is most commonly supplied in tablets of 100 mg and 200 mg each.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Modafinil is a central nervous system stimulant related to adrafinil.

The drug may also produce gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dry mouth, anorexia, and  headache.  Hypertension,  heart  palpitations,  or abnormal heart rate may also be noticed. In rare instances allergic  rash,  increases  in  alkaline  phosphatase,  or impaired voluntary movement have been reported.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1751">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used clinically to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea, the recommended dose is typically 200 to 400 mg per day. This may be given in a single morning application, or in two divided doses (morning and at midday). When used to enhance physical performance, the typical effective dose is in the range of 100-400 mg. This is often given at least 2-3 hours prior to athletic competition. Note that side effects can be dose dependant. It Is often advised to start using modafinil on the low end of the effective dosage range, and increase by 50-100 mg per application until an optimal level is determined.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The arenas in which this drug is applied are vast, and essentially include any sport focused on aerobic activity or endurance. It may also work well with those athletes focused on short repeat bursts of strength or speed (anaerobic activities), such as shot-putting, pole-vaulting, or long-jumping. Modafinil is not a popular drug among bodybuilders, as it holds little direct value for building muscle or reducing body fat levels.

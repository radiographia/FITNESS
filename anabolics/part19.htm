Specifically, this agent is the first in a newer class of third- generation selective oral aromatase inhibitors.<span class="s33">1 </span>It acts by blocking the enzyme aromatase, subsequently blocking the production of estrogen in the body. Since many forms of breast cancer cells are stimulated by estrogen, reducing levels of this hormone in the body may retard the progression of the disease.This is also the fundamental use of tamoxifen citrate (Nolvadex®), except Nolvadex blocks the action of estrogen at the receptor, not its actual endogenous production.The effects of anastrozole can be very substantial, with a daily dose of Img (commonly 1 tablet) capable of producing estrogen suppression greater than 80% in treated patients. With the powerful effect this drug has on hormone levels, it is usually only prescribed to post-menopausal women. Side effects like hot flashes and hair thinning can present themselves during therapy, and would be much more severe in pre-menopausal patients. For the steroid-using male athlete, anastrozole is applied to minimize  the  side  effects  associated  with  elevated estrogen levels secondary to anabolic/androgenic steroid use. In comparison with traditional methods such as Nolvadex and Proviron, anastrozole is significantly more effective at controlling estrogen.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1577">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anastrozole was developed by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, and approved for use in the United States at the end of 1995.The drug was developed as a new adjunct treatment for operable breast cancer in postmenopausal female patients, an area of medicine that had a long history of tamoxifen use. Substantial data was needed to shift prescribing  trends  away  from  such  an  established medication treatment. Shortly after its release, anastrozole was investigated as part of an extremely large multicenter double blind trial based out of Rome (ATAC). The study evaluated the use of anastrozole and tamoxifen,aloneorin combination, in 9,366 postmenopausal women following breast cancer surgery. The results favored anastrozole over tamoxifen at promoting disease regression and improving overall survival rates. Upon publication of this trial in 2002, anastrozole  emerged  as  a  new  contender  for  the adjunctive treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer.<span class="s33">2 3 </span>Around this same time the drug was also gained popularity with male bodybuilders and athletes who began taking notice of the strong estrogen suppression caused by anastrozole, both in the anecdotal reports of others and in clinical trials.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1578">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Anastrozole is most commonly supplied in tablets of 1 mg.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1579">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Anastrozole is classified as a selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients. Some individuals may also respond  to  the  medication  with  gastrointestinal  side effects  including  nausea  and  vomiting.  Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy. When taken by men (as an off-label use) to reduce estrogenicity  during  prolonged  periods  of  steroid treatment,   aromatase   inhibitors   may   increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by retarding some beneficial properties of estrogen on cholesterol values. Studies have demonstrated that when an aromatizabie steroid  such  as  testosterone  enanthate  is  taken  in conjunction with an aromatase inhibitor, suppression of HDL (good) cholesterol levels become significantly more pronounced.   Since   the   estrogen   receptor agonist/antagonist Nolvadex® generally does not display the same anti-estrogenic (negative) effect on cholesterol values, it is usually favored over aromatase inhibitors for estrogen maintenance by male bodybuilders and athletes concerned with cardiovascular health.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Anastrozole is FDA approved for adjunctive treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">early   breast   cancer,   first-line   treatment   of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive or receptor unknown locally advanced metastatic breast cancer, and treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal  women  with  disease  progression following tamoxifen therapy.The dosage prescribed in all instances is 1mg per day until disease progression has halted.

It is very  similar  in  structure  and  action  to  formestane, although it is significantly more potent in comparison. As a class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors offer an anti-estrogenic effect by blocking the enzyme responsible for synthesizing estrogens. Exemestane is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer in women, specifically in post­ menopausal  patients  whose  cancer  has  progressed following therapy with tamoxifen. Male bodybuilders and athletes often use the drug for non-approved purposes, namely to counter the estrogenic side effects associated with the use of aromatizable anabolic/androgenic steroids. This may include gynecomastia, fat buildup, and water retention. In some instances aromatase inhibitors may also assist this group with the loss of body fat and increases in muscular definition. Exemestane is one of the most potent aromatase  inhibitors  presently  available.  The  most commonly cited data (found in the Aromasin packaging insert) reports a lowering of serum estrogen levels by 85% on average in clinical studies with women .</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1584">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Exemestane was developed by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn (Pharmacia), which gained FDA approval for sale of the drug in late 1999. They introduced it under the Aromasin brand name in early 2000. Although the drug proved to be effective in doses as low as 2.5 mg per day in some patients</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">, the company developed it in a standard and near universally effective dosage of 25 mg per tablet. The company has since introduced the drug to many other nations under the same trade name. Due to various patents and general market dominance, Aromasin is the only brand name of exemestane one is likely to come across in general commerce at the present time. It is currently available in over three dozen countries including Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and Venezuela.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1585">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1586">Exemestane is most commonly supplied in tablets of 25 mg.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Exemestane is classified as an irreversible steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

In clinical medicine it is specifically referred to as a nonsteroidal ovulatory stimulant.The drug works by interacting with estrogen receptors, often in an antagonistic  manner,  in  various  tissues  of  the  body including   the   hypothalamus,   pituitary,   ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. One main focus is that the drug wifi oppose the negative feedback of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, enhancing the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH). This surge in gonadotropins may cause egg release (follicular rupture), ideally  leading  to  conception.  Clomiphene  citrate  is chemically   a   synthetic   estrogen   with   both agonist/antagonist properties, and in this regard is very similar in structure and action to Nolvadex®. It is believed that both the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties of clomiphene citrate play a role in its ability to support female fertility.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">In men, clomiphene citrate also acts as a partial anti- estrogen, and may be used to counter some of the side effects of aromatizable steroid use including gynecomastia and increased water retention. As an anti-estrogenic drug, clomiphene citrate may also produce an elevation of follicle  stimulating  hormone,  and  luteinizing  hormone levels, which can elevate testosterone production. This effect is especially beneficial at the conclusion of a steroid cycle,  when  endogenous  testosterone  levels  are depressed. Here, clomiphene citrate is most often applied in combination with hCG and tamoxifen, in an effort to restore endogenous testosterone production more quickly (see PCT: Post-Cycle Therapy), If testosterone levels are not brought back to normal in a short period of time, a significant loss in size and strength may occur. This is due to  the  fact  that  without  testosterone  (or  other anabolic/androgenic  steroids)  to  impart  an  ongoing anabolic  message,  the  catabolic  hormone  cortisol becomes the dominant force affecting muscle protein synthesis. Often referred to as the post-steroid crash, when not corrected this state of imbalance in the endocrine system can quickly reduce muscle mass levels, diminishing the  long-term  return  on  anabolic/androgenic  steroid therapy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that the triphenylethylene compounds (toremifene citrate, tamoxifen citrate, clomiphene citrate) tend to be somewhat intrinsically estrogenic in the liver. This means that while they can block estrogenic activity in some areas of the body, they can actually act as estrogens in this other</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">key area. Estrogenic action in the liver is important in the regulation of serum cholesterol (it tends to support HDL synthesis  and  LDL  reductions).  Since  steroid-using bodybuilders  are  already  dealing  with  the  negative cardiovascular effects of these drugs, compounding the issue with aromatase inhibitors (which will lower total serum estrogen levels) may not always be the best option. Using a drug that blocks gynecomastia, for example, while at the same time supporting improved cholesterol values, might be much more ideal.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1591">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1592">Clomiphene citrate is a fertility drug with a substantial history of use in the United States. It  first gained widespread acceptance during the early 1970s, and has been a drug common to the fertility practice ever since. The drug is now considered a standard medication for certain forms of fertility therapy, and has been adopted as such far outside U.S. border. Clomiphene citrate is presently available in most nations worldwide.The two most popular brand names one is likely to encounter are Clomid and Serofene, although the drug can be found under numerous other trade names as well including (but not limited to) Sepafar, Omifin, Pergotime, Gonaphene, Duinum, Clostil, Ova-Mit, and Clostibegyt. Clomiphene citrate is generally a very inexpensive medication compared to stronger anti­ estrogens such as the newer selective third-generation aromatase inhibitors. It, likewise, remains a very popular agent of use among bodybuilders and athletes.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Clomiphene citrate Is most commonly supplied in tablets of 50 mg.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1593">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clomiphene citrate is classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, with both agonist and antagonist properties.

Its primary function is to block the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, which  is  required  for  the  biosynthesis  of  adrenal glucocorticoids,  mineralocorticoids,  estrogens,  and androgens. Aminoglutethimide is a nonspecific inhibitor, and also blocks several other steps in steroid synthesis including hydroxylation at C-11, C-18, and C-21, and the aromatization of androgens to estrogens.The drug may be used clinically to treat estrogen dependent breast cancer, and to treat Cushing&#39;s syndrome, which is a condition where the body overproduces the hormone cortisol. The effect that aminogluthethimide can have on cortisol and estrogen production is what makes this a drug of interest to athletes and bodybuilders.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Cortisol Inhibition: While cortisol is an essential hormone for life, its levels may also vary greatly within &quot;normal&quot; ranges depending on the individual, their training and dietary status, and many other personal metabolic factors. It has been a common pursuit in the sports community to find ways to control (limit) cortisol production. This is because while androgens give your muscle cells a message to  increase  protein  synthesis,  cortisol  (a  catabolic hormone) imparts a message to breakdown and release amino acids. If one can limit this catabolic message, net protein  synthesis  should,  in  theory,  be  increased. Aminoglutethimide has been used by a number of athletes and bodybuilders for this purpose, usually in combination with anabolic/androgenic steroids because it has a low level  of  androgen  inhibition.  Together  with  even  a relatively small dose, it was thought one could shift the ratio of anabolic to catabolic hormones in favor of the former, the goal being new muscle growth.The results for this use have been mixed.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When first looked at in the realm of athletics, however, research  was  bare  as  to  the  best  way  to  use aminoglutethimide as a cortisol lowering anti-catabolic. Dubbed the &quot;adrenal escape phenomenon&quot; it has been noted that after a short period of regular use your body often reacts to lowered cortisol levels by increasing the release of another hormone, ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Increased ACTH could overcome the activity of aminoglutethimide, resulting in your body resuming its original levels of cortisol production (negating the benefits of  cortisol  inhibition).<span class="s33">1  </span>A  moderate  amount  of hydrocortisone (20-30 mg daily) is given to patients when this occurs. This can keep glucocorticoid activity from completely diminishing, preventing the ACTH response</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">and allowing the drug to retain its effect. For athletes, however, supplementing glucocorticoids would probably be counterproductive given the desired goal. A 2-day-on 2- day-off  regime  of  administration  was,  therefore, implemented as a way to delay or even avoid the adrenal escape phenomenon. This strategy is based on theory and experimentation, however, and no clinical studies have evaluated aminiglutethimide as an anti-catabolic agent.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: center;">It is important to note that while many people believe they have used this drug as an anti-catabolic, few have actually taken the correct dosage. Four tablets per day, or 1,000 mg, appears necessary to significantly inhibit the demolase enzyme  (the  enzyme  responsible  for  converting cholesterol to pregnenolone,and the target when reduced cortisol is desired). Those who do venture this high commonly report fatigue and discomfort, stating that the drug is intolerable for any type of prolonged use. Today, many athletes and bodybuilders are accepting that the original proposed use of aminogluthethimide as a non­ steroidal muscle-building agent does not seem to be a plausible one. The only instances this author has really heard of this drug ever being used at such doses consistently with any type of positive response were competitive  bodybuilders  partaking  in  high-dosed Cytadren shortly before a contest.They claimed the short­ term rise in androgen to corticosteroid ratio greatly aided their abilities to bring out a show-ready hard and dense physique, and credit the drug as genuinely being a very effective pre-contest agent. In speaking with the late Paul Borresen he summed up the pre-contest use of Cytadren</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">by stating, <i><b>&quot;I have had considerable experience with the high dose use. It makes athletes sleepy and weak. It seems to help the last ten days before a show, and this is tried and tested.&quot;</b></i></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Aromatase Inhibition: Aminoglutethimide is an efficient aromatase inhibitor, and tends to inhibit the activity of this enzyme at a much lower dosage from that what is required for inhibition of corticosteroid production.<span class="s33">2 3 </span>While a daily dosage of 1000 mg is typically needed to inhibit cortisol, maximum suppression of aromatase and estrogen levels is typically achieved at a dosage between 250 mg and 500</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">mg, a point where strong adrenal steroid blockage is not noted.There also seems to be no added benefit by adding cortisol in terms of survival/response rate among breast cancer patients, pointing to the fact that the &quot;adrenal escape phenomenon&quot; bears little relation to its abilities as an aromatase inhibitor. Ultimately, it appears that not only do we need a higher dose (1,000 mg or 4 tablets per day minimum) to really inhibit cortisol production, but also that there is no need for an athlete to implement a rotating dose schedule if the drug is being used as an anti­ estrogen.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Aminoglutethimide  is  usually  regarded  highly  among athletes and bodybuilders as an estrogen maintenance agent. Studies have shown it to be capable of decreasing aromatase activity by as much as 92% after administration of 250 mg per day. Patient response rates also show aminoglutethimide to be at least as effective as tamoxifen therapy in treating estrogen dependent cancer cells, and more  effective  under  certain  conditions.  Due  to  its discussed broad range of non-specific activity, however, including the potential inhibition of not only estrogens, but corticosteroids, aldosterone, and androgens as well, it is not regarded as highly as newer (second and third generation)  aromatase  inhibitors  in  terms  of  patient comfort and efficacy, and is not widely used for this purpose today. Athletes, however, still tend to consider it to be an effective remedy for estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, increased water retention, and fat gain.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Aminoglutethimide  was  FDA  approved  as  an anticonvulsant drug in 1960. Side effects were common with treatment, however, including drowsiness, dizziness, and partial loss of motor control. In 1966 reports of adrenal insufficiency  subsequent to aminoglutethimide use were reported.The drug was withdrawn from the U.S. market as an anticonvulsant that same year due to its recently understood effects on the adrenal gland. By 1967, however, the drug was reintroduced for a new purpose, namely inhibition of aromatase activity and the treatment of breast cancer. It was one of the first aromatase inhibitors sold, and is identified alongside testolactone as a &quot;first-generation&quot; agent of this type. Given its novel effects on adrenal steroid production, the</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">U.S.  FDA  also  granted  approval  for  the  use  of aminoglutethimide  for  the  treatment  of  Cushing&#39;s syndrome.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">At  one  time  aminoglutethimide  was  available  under numerous brand names and in more than 2-dozen countries. Ciba&#39;s Cytadren and Orimeten preparations were by far the most common, and could be found in such nations as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong,</p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the drug could be found on occasion under other names including Aminoblastin, Rodazol, and Mamomit.The vast majority of original aminoglutethimide preparations have since  been  discontinued,  however.  Today,  the  drug remains available in a very small number of countries, most  notably  the  United  States  (Cytadren),  Russia (Mamomit),  Hong  Kong  (Orimetene),  and  Australia (Cytadren).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1600">How Supplied:</a></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1601">Aminoglutethimide is most commonly supplied in tablets of 250 mg.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Aminoglutethimide is an analog of glutethimide.

Other side effects may include sleep disorder, apathy, depression, vomiting, stomach upset, thyroid dysfunction, virilizationjaundice, elevated cholesterol levels, changes in blood cell counts, and high blood pressure. Additionally, those bodybuilders and athletes taking it at a dosage high enough to promote cortisol suppression often note that reduced levels of this hormone bring about more aches and pains in the joints when trying to lift heavyweights.lt seems logical that this might lead to an increased susceptibility to injury. Users should be careful not to overexert themselves during the short periods in which this drug is used in high doses. Most of the listed side effects listed here are most common with higher dosed regimens that inhibit the adrenal production of cortisol, and are less common with athletes taking one or two tablets per day as an anti-estrogen. Even in low doses aminoglutethimide may cause birth defects, and should never be taken during pregnancy.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1603">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Aminoglutethimide  is  medically  indicated  for  the treatment  of  Cushing&#39;s  syndrome,  metastatic  breast cancer  in  postmenopausal  women,  and  palliative treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer.

A schedule of 2-days on, 2-days off may be used in an attempt   to   extend   the   effectiveness   of aminoglutethimide for longer periods, but such use is usually  discarded  in  place  of  daily  short-term administration. The dosage most commonly used for mitigating   the   estrogenic   side   effects   of anabolic/androgenic steroid use ranges from 125 mg to 500 mg per day (1/2 to 2 tablets), with 1 tablet (250 mg) per day appearing to be the most common dosage selected.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Aminoglutethimide is produced in a small number of countries, and is a fairly expensive pharmaceutical.

This drug is similar in effect to tamoxifen,  exhibiting  estrogen  receptor  antagonist (blocking) properties in some tissues while acting as an estrogen receptor agonist (activator) in others. The main point of variation between these two agents is their tissue selectivity. While raloxifene hydrochloride is a strong anti- estrogen in breast and uterine tissues, it appears to be estrogenic in bone. This allows it to protect bone density, mimicking the beneficial effects of endogenous estradiol. This is quite different from tamoxifen, which is anti­ estrogenic in both breast and bone. In a role that was novel for  an  anti-estrogen,  raloxifene  hydrochloride  was approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. It is also being investigated for several other potential uses, including the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, gynecomastia, prostate cancer, acromegaly, and uterine cancer.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">As an anti-estrogen, athletes and bodybuilders may use this compound to combat the estrogenic side effects caused  by  aromatizable  or  estrogenic  steroids.  The principle among these side effects is gynecomastia, a purpose for which raloxifene hydrochloride seems better suited than tamoxifen. This was demonstrated in a July 2004 study in the <i><b>Journal of Pediatrics, </b></i>which looked at how these two agents compared in the treatment of persistent pubertal  gynecomastia.<span class="s33">1  </span>The  investigation  involved  a group of 38 patients, averaging 15 years of age and suffering from gynecomastia for a little over 2 years. Treatment for 3 to 9 months with either agent had a high success rate for seeing &quot;some improvement&quot; (91% for raloxifene and 86% for Nolvadex). However, a significant reduction of gynecomastia was seen in more than twice as many  patients  with  raloxifene  hydrochloride  (86% compared to 41%). Given its relative potency, raloxifene hydrochloride may offer an alternative to surgery for some cases of gynecomastia.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Typical  of  an  anti-estrogen,  raloxifene  hydrochloride should  also  offer  some  benefit  as  a  testosterone- stimulating compound. We see this effect demonstrated in studies on a group of older men (aged 60-70 years), where daily doses of 120 mg were able to increase serum and bioavailable (unbound) testosterone by 20%? Though these figures are not dramatic, they do demonstrate an anti-estrogenic effect instead of an estrogenic (negative) one when it comes to testosterone production. This drug</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">may, therefore, be of some value when utilized as an adjunct to HCG injections during a post-cycle testosterone recovery program. This same study above also showed raloxifene  hydrochloride  to  have  at  least  a  partial estrogenic effect on serum lipids, exhibiting a trend toward decreases in all cholesterol values (total, LDL, and HDL). It is difficult to discern if there are any real benefits to male bodybuilders  when  it  comes  to  using  raloxifene hydrochloride to counteract the negative cardiovascular side effects of steroid use. As discussed in its respective profile, this may be a notable benefit with the use of Nolvadex, a first-generation SERM agent shown to improve HDL (good) cholesterol levels in many patients.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1606">There are some negatives to inhibiting the actions of estrogen that should be addressed. For one, estrogen is a beneficial hormone when it comes to IGF-1 levels. In studies with acromegaly patients that suffer from GH hypersecretion, 60 mg of raloxifene hydrochloride twice daily was able to reliably suppress IGF-1 levels by an average of 16%.</a><span class="s33">3 </span>Estrogen is also understood <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>exert positive anabolic effects in regards to increasing androgen receptor concentrations in certain tissues, and enhancing enzymes involved in the utilization of glucose for tissue growth and repair.This is further support for the belief that anti-estrogens should not be used unless there is a defined reason for doing so. When used for simple side-effect prevention (without visible side effects occurring), the drug may inadvertently lessen the total anabolic potency of steroid therapy.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Raloxifene hydrochloride was developed by Eli Lilly &amp; Company, and FDA approved for U.S. sale in 1997. Its first indicated use was as that of an osteoporosis treatment, owing to its ability to increase bone density. In 2007, the FDA expanded the indicated uses for the drug to include reducing  the  risk  of  invasive  breast  cancer  in  two populations: postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer. Today, raloxifene hydrochloride is a fairly</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">popular drug in clinical medicine, and is approved for sale in over 50 countries.

Aside from a small number of other brands, the Evista product from Eli Lilly &amp; Company is most likely to be encountered. Price is often a concern, as raloxifene hydrochloride is considerably more expensive than some of  the  anti-estrogens  bodybuilders  and  athletes  are already accustomed to such as Nolvadex and Ciomid.The price per individual daily dose of raloxifene hydrochloride (1 tablet) can exceed $2. That would add up to $200 or more per 100 doses. A hundred tablets of generic tamoxifen (20 mg) often sell for approximately $50.This is about 50 cents per dose, or 1 /4th the price of raloxifene hydrochloride. Thus far, price, not availability, seem to be preventing the more widespread diversion of raloxifene hydrochloride for black market sale.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s68" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 5pt;text-align: justify;">1  <span class="s67">Beneficial effects of raloxifene and tamoxifen in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia.

It is a  non-steroidal  triphenylethylene  derivative,  similar  in structure and action to both Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) and Clomid (clomiphene citrate).Toremifene citrate is used for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women  with  estrogen-receptor  positive  or  estrogen- receptor unknown (unsure if the cancer is estrogen responsive) tumors. It works by attaching to the estrogen receptor in various tissues in a competitive manner, blocking endogenous estrogen from exerting biological activity.  As  an  anti-estrogen  in  many  tissues,  male bodybuilders and athletes may use toremifene citrate to counter some of the side effects associated with the use of aromatizable or estrogenic anabolic/androgenic steroids. This  may  include  gynecomastia,  body  fat  gain,  and increased water retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  triphenylethylene  compounds  (toremifene  citrate, tamoxifen  citrate,  clomiphene  citrate)  tend  to  be somewhat intrinsically estrogenic in the liver. This means that while they can block estrogenic activity in some areas of the body, they can actually act as estrogens in this other key area. Estrogenic action in the liver is important in the regulation of serum cholesterol (it tends to support HDL synthesis  and  LDL  reductions).  Since  steroid-using bodybuilders  are  already  dealing  with  the  negative cardiovascular effects of these drugs, compounding the issue with aromatase inhibitors (which will lower total serum estrogen levels) may not always be the best option. Using a drug that blocks gynecomastia, for example, while at the same time supporting improved cholesterol values, might  be  much  more  ideal.  In  terms  of  which triphenylethylene agent is most effective in this regard, evidence suggests that the positive lipid altering benefits of toremifene are significantly stronger than those of tamoxifen , a drug normally favored for this purpose. Toremifene citrate may, therefore, be the preferred anti- estrogen among those concerned about their lipid profiles.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1614">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Toremifene citrate was approved by the FDA as a prescription drug in 1997.

It exerts its action in the body not by targeting the production of estrogen, but by preventing it from exerting activity in the body. It does this by binding available estrogen receptors in a competitive manner, making them unavailable for circulating estrogens. This mode of action is very similar to Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) and Clomid (clomiphene citrate), although unlike these  two  agents  fulvestrant  does  not  have  mixed agonist/antagonist  properties.  It  is  a  pure  estrogen receptor antagonist.This agent also stands out as the first injectable estrogen antagonist to catch the attention of the athletic/bodybuilding world. Although not widely used here, when applied it may be an effective drug for mitigating the side effects of excess estrogen caused by anabolic/androgenic steroid use such as gynecomastia, fat buildup, and increased water retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Fulvestrant is very potent as an anti-estrogen, significantly more so than earlier medications like Nolvadex and Clomid. Although it targets estrogen at its receptor and not its production, it can still produce an environment of low estrogenicity on par with strong aromatase inhibition. One study, for example, shows fulvestrant to be as effective in Arimidex in treating breast cancer patients who have already  failed  with  first  line  endocrine  treatments.<span class="s33">1 </span>Another shows the drug prevents tumor cell turnover and growth  significantly  more  effectively  than  tamoxifen citrate.<span class="s33">2 </span>Studies investigating the physiological response to fulvestrant note that the drug actually downregulates estrogen receptor concentrations. Furthermore, it also tends   to   downregulate   progesterone   receptor concentrations.<span class="s33">3 </span>Fulvestrant does not cross the blood brain barrier, and for this reason is believed to produce fewer neurological side effects related to estrogen antagonism such as hot flashes, mood alterations, and low energy.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1621">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Fulvestrant  was  developed  by  AstraZeneca.

The structure and activity of this compound  are  very  similar  to  that  of  Arimidex (anastrozole), and it is prescribed for similar medical purposes. More specifically, U.S. prescribing guidelines for letrozole recommend it be used for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive or estrogen receptor-unknown (unsure if the cancer is responsive to estrogen) breast cancer. It is typically used as a second line of treatment after an estrogen-receptor antagonist like tamoxifen has failed to elicit a desirable response, although it is sometimes initiated as the first course of therapy depending on the circumstances. Male bodybuilders and athletes find value in letrozole for its ability to mitigate the estrogenic side effects associated with the use of aromatizable anabolic/androgenic steroids, such as gynecomastia, fat buildup, and visible water retention.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Letrozole represents one of the newer achievements in a long line of drugs targeting aromatase inhibition. It is among  the  most  potent  estrogen-lowering  drugs developed to date, and has an effect significantly stronger than non-selective first generation aromatase inhibitors like Teslac and Cytadren. The dosage of each tablet of Femara is 2.5 milligrams, which according to product information was sufficient to lower estrogen levels by an average of 78% during clinical trails. The drug, however, appears to often remain quite effective in lower doses.The package insert for the product itself comments that during clinical studies doses as low as .1 and .5 milligrams produced 75 and 78% estrogen inhibition, respectively in many patients.The recommended dose, likewise, reflects a level that seems to elicit a desired level of inhibition in nearly all patients.  A large number of people may, therefore, respond well to lower doses of the drug.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1629">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration approved letrozole for prescription sale in 1997, where it is sold by Novartis under the Femara trade name. Novartis also extensively markets the drug in other nations, and more than 70 nations now carry letrozole as an approved drug. The Femara  brand  is  by  far  the  dominant  preparation worldwide, and is found in such nations as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, Italy, South Africa, Switzerland, and Russia.

Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients. Some individuals may also respond  to  the  medication  with  gastrointestinal  side effects  including  nausea  and  vomiting.  Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy. When taken by men (as an off-label use) to reduce estrogenicity  during  prolonged  periods  of  steroid treatment,   aromatase   inhibitors   may   increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by retarding some beneficial properties of estrogen on cholesterol values.

The recommended dose of letrozole is one 2.5 mg tablet administered once per day, without regard to meals. When used (off-label) to mitigate the estrogenic side effects of anabolic/androgenic steroid use or increase muscle definition, male athletes and bodybuilders often take 1.25 mg to 2.5 mg per day. In some cases a dosage of a half of <span style=" color: #393939;">a </span>tablet (1.25 mg) taken every other day is sufficient <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>prevent the onset of estrogenic side effects.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1634">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Letrozole is most commonly sold under the brand name Femara by the international drug-manufacturing firm Novartis.

It is very similar in structure to Clomid® and Nolvadex®, and also works in the body as a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist.This drug is commonly  used  for  off-label  purposes  by  male bodybuilders and athletes, typically at the conclusion of a steroid cycle for the purpose of increasing endogenous testosterone levels. This is in an attempt to minimize the negative impact that a period of low androgen levels may have on the physique, which can include significant muscle loss.The drug HCG is also commonly used for this purpose, but  it  works  by  mimicking  the  action  of  luteinizing hormone, not as an anti-estrogen. HCG is typically looked at as a rapid acting drug, used in the first couple of weeks after  the  steroids  are  withdrawn.  Anti-estrogens  like cyclofenil, Clomid® and/or Nolvadex® are often used in conjunction with HCG, but may be continued for several weeks after the HCG has been removed (see PCT; Post­ Cycle Therapy).</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1636">Cyclofenil stimulates the release of testosterone via its anti­ estrogenic action. The hypothalamus is one target site of this. By interfering with the binding of estrogen to its receptor in this area of the body, cyclofenil blocks the negative feedback inhibition brought fourth by this sex hormone.The enhanced release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) may result, which in turn would stimulate the  pituitary  to  heighten  the  release  of  luteinizing hormone. LH is the primary signal for the testes to increase the production of testosterone, so its increased release (provided the testes are properly sensitive to LH) leads to an elevation in the androgen level. The anti-estrogenic effect of this drug in breast tissue has also led to its use during a steroid cycle to prevent gynecomastia, similar to how Nolvadex® might be used. Cyclofenil, however, is reported to be somewhat weaker than Nolvadex®, which is usually  preferred  as  an  estrogen  maintenance  drug. Women do occasionally find a use for anti-estrogens, most often around contest time when the management of endogenous estrogens can help increase fat loss and definition.The side effects that can be brought about by a lowering of estrogen activity in the female body are usually strong and uncomfortable, however, making this approach less than ideal.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyclofenil was developed during the early 1960s, a time when other agents of the same class (such as tamoxifen and clomiphene) were being thoroughly investigated.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1637">Cyclofenil was soon released as a prescription drug agent, sold mainly to increase the chance of conception and to counter certain menopausal symptoms. Although the drug seemed to offer a good clinical effect without significant health concerns, it did not see extensive success on the global market. Instead, Nolvadex and Clomid dominated this drug category for many decades. Still, cyclofenil did not  completely  disappear,  and  remained  available  in certain nations. The most popular brand was Fertodur, produced by Schering. It was sold in a few countries, including Brazil, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, and Turkey. Other popular brands have included Rehibin (U.K.), Menopax (Brazil), Neoclym (Italy), Sexovid (Japan), and Ondogyne  (France).  Today,  although  most  original cyclofenil products have been discontinued, the drug can still be found in some areas including Turkey, Italy, and Brazil.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cyclofenil is most commonly supplied in tablets of 200 mg.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1638">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyclofenil is classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, with both agonist and antagonist properties.lt has    the    chemical    designation    4,4&#39;- (Cydohexylidenemethylene)bis(phenyl acetate).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1639">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyclofenil  appears  to  be  well  tolerated,  with  a  low incidence of significant side effects. Common adverse reactions  include  liver  enzyme  elevations,  vasomotor flushes   (hot   flashes),   abdominal   discomfort, nausea/vomiting,  breast  discomfort,  headache,  and abnormal uterine bleeding. Premenopausal women may be more susceptible to hot flashes due to the stronger effect estrogenic disruption can have on this population. In males, the testosterone boosting properties of cyclofenil may result in some androgenic side effects including oily skin, acne, and increased libido.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1640">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Cyclofenil is most commonly used (medically) to treat anovulatory infertility. Therapeutic protocols recommend a dose of 200 mg three times per day for 5 days, which is initiated nearthe start of the menstrual cycle. If pregnancy is not achieved with the first cycle, it may be used for 3 or 4 cycles in total. In some instances the drug is also given in lower doses to treat menopausal symptoms. When used after steroid administration (off-label) to increase natural testosterone production, a dosage 400-600 mg per day is the most common, it is often used for a period of 4 to 5 weeks as part of a comprehensive post-cycle recovery program in place of Clomid (see PCT: Post-Cycle Therapy). Similar  doses  are  used  for  estrogen  maintenance purposes while on-cycle, although Nolvadex is usually given preference for this purpose. Some athletes have experimented  with  using  cyclofenil  as  a  standalone anabolic, finding its ability to increase testosterone levels beneficial. The dosage used for this purpose is typically 400-600 mg per day for 6-8 weeks. While some have reported this approach to be effective, many others find the drug too mild, especially in light of the effects of exogenous testosterone.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Cyclofenil is not widely produced.

This  group,  however,  is  responsible  for  causing  an irreversible  attachment  between  formestane  and aromatase when the two come into contact with each other. This means that formestane will bond with the enzyme and never let it go, permanently deactivating it as a result. The enzyme will need to be replaced, through normal attrition, before the body will recover its lost estrogen synthesizing capacity.This may take several days or more following cessation of therapy. Given this mode of action, formestane is also referred to as a &quot;suicide&quot; aromatase inhibitor, as the drug essentially sacrifices itself in the process of blocking estrogen conversion. As a class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors are used (off-label) by male bodybuilders and athletes to prevent the estrogenic side effects of certain anabolic/androgenic steroids, and to increase fat loss and muscle definition while dieting.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Because  of  its  potent  estrogen-suppressing  action, formestane has been used clinically to treat breast cancer patients in a number of countries including England, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and Malaysia .It has been shown to be an effective option as a second line of defense after tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, has failed to elicit a positive response with patients, and produces an overall response statistically similar to tamoxifen when administered as the first-line therapy . In terms of overall potency, formestane is not as strong as the selective third generation inhibitors like Arimidex (anastrozole) or Femara (letrozole). One study, for example, notes a 79% level of suppression of estrogen levels with 4 weeks use of Arimidex 1 mg daily (on par with levels noted with Femara use), but only a 58% level  of  suppression  with  intramuscular  formestane injections (250 mg every two weeks). But next to estrogen receptor antagonists like Ciomid (clomiphene citrate) and Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate), formestane is significantly more effective at blocking the effects of estrogen in the body.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1642">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Formestane was the first selective aromatase inhibitor to be developed as a prescription drug, first appearing in Europe during the mid-1990s under the Lentaron Depot brand name.

With  the  emergence  of  newer  and  more  effective aromatase  inhibitors,  however,  formestane  soon  lost market presence at a rapid rate.Most of the initial Lentaron Depot preparations have since been discontinued.

Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients. Some individuals may also respond  to  the  medication  with  gastrointestinal  side effects  including  nausea  and  vomiting.  Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy. When taken by men (as an off-label use) to reduce estrogenicity  during  prolonged  periods  of  steroid treatment,   aromatase   inhibitors   may   increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by retarding some beneficial properties of estrogen on cholesterol values.

It is specifically a Selective Estrogen-Receptor   Modulator   (SERM)   of   the triphenylethylene family, and possesses both estrogen agonist and antagonist properties. As such, <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>may act as an estrogen in some tissues while blocking the action of estrogen in others. In breast tissue tamoxifen citrate is a strong anti-estrogen,and as a result it is commonly used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer in women. In some cases it is even utilized as a preventative measure, taken by women with an extremely high familial tendency for breast cancer. In male bodybuilders and athletes, tamoxifen citrate is commonly used (off-label) to counter the side effects caused by elevated estrogens subsequent to the use of certain anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The  primary  worry  among  the  athletic/bodybuilding population  is  gynecomastia,  or  the  very  unsightly development of female breast tissue in men. This can be first noticed by the appearance of swelling or a small lump under the nipple. If left to progress, this can develop into a large hard-tissue gynecomastia that may be an irreversible occurrence without surgery.The estrogen can also lead to an increase in the level of water retained in the body, resulting in a notable loss of definition as the muscles begin to look smooth (even bloated) due to the retention of subcutaneous fluid. Fat storage may also be increased as estrogen levels rise in men. In fact, differences in the estrogen/androgen ratio are one of the reasons women have a higher body fat percentage, and different fat distribution (hips/thighs), than men.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tamoxifen citrate also possesses the ability to increase production of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). This is accomplished by blocking negative feedback inhibition caused by estrogen at the hypothalamus, which (via the actions of GnRH) fosters the release of the mentioned pituitary hormones. This is very similar to the function of Clomid® and cyclofenil. Since a higher release of LH can stimulate the Leydig&#39;s cells in the testes (men) to produce more testosterone, tamoxifen citrate  can  have  a  positive  impact  on  one&#39;s  serum testosterone level.This &quot;testosterone stimulating&quot; effect is an added benefit when preparing to conclude a steroid cycle. Since anabolic/androgenic steroids tend to suppress endogenous  testosterone  production,  tamoxifen  citrate can help restore a balance in hormone levels. It is most commonly used as part of a comprehensive post cycle recovery program (see PCT: Post-Cycle Recovery).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that like some other triphenylethylene compounds, tamoxifen citrate can act as an estrogen in the liver <span style=" color: #393939;">. </span>Estrogenic action in the liver is important in the regulation of serum cholesterol, and tends to support HDL (good) cholesterol synthesis and LDL (bad) cholesterol reductions. Since steroid-using bodybuilders are already dealing with the  negative  cardiovascular  effects  of  these  drugs, compounding the issue with aromatase inhibitors (which will lower total serum estrogen levels) may not always be the best option. Using a drug that blocks gynecomastia, for example, while at the same time supporting improved cholesterol values, might be much more ideal. It is important to note that tamoxifen citrate is not sufficient to stabilize serum cholesterol at healthy levels with the use of c-17alpha alkylated orals or high doses of steroids in general. The effect it would have on cholesterol values would likely be one of degrees, and cannot be relied upon to  eliminate  cardiovascular  disease  risk  from anabolic/androgenic steroid use.</p><p class="s119" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tamoxifen citrate was first synthesized in 1962 by ICI . It was made commercially available in the U.S. not long after, but was initially used to treat certain forms of female infertility, a purpose for which tamoxifen citrate does not seemed ideally suited. In 1971, the first clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of tamoxifen citrate in breast cancer patients were undertaken .Two years later, noting the link between estrogen and breast cancer and the success of early trials, ICI pursued marketing the drug in the U.S. to treat breast cancer. It was not until 1977 that FDA approval for this use would finally be granted. Tamoxifen citrate was sold by ICI in a wide number of countries under the Nolvadex brand name (the company would later become known as AstraZeneca). A number of generics  and  other  brands  followed,  presently  too numerous to list. In 1998, the FDA approved expanding the indicated uses of tamoxifen citrate to include breast cancer prevention for women at high risk for developing the disease.

This may be one reason why gains made with a strong aromatizable androgen like testosterone are usually more pronounced than those achieved with anabolic steroids that aromatizes to a lower (or no) degree. Therefore, it is usually advised to identify a specific need for tamoxifen citrate before committing to its use during a cycle. Many people,  in  fact,  find  the  use  of  an  anti-estrogen unnecessary,   even   when   utilizing   problematic compounds such as testosterone or methandrostenolone. Others, however, find they are troubled by water retention and gynecomastia even with milder (less estrogenic) drugs  like  Deca-Durabolin®  and  Equipoise®.  The estrogenic response to steroid use is very individual, and may be influenced by factors such as age and body fat percentage  (adipose  tissue  is  a  primary  site  of aromatization).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Tamoxifen citrate is widely manufactured, and can be found in virtually every developed nation of the world.

Its exact mode of action is unknown, but it is believed to inhibit the aromatase enzyme in a noncompetitive and irreversible manner. If so, this would be an activity that is very similar to that of Lentaron  (formestane).  This  might  also  explain  why cessation of the drug does not provide an immediate restoration  of  normal  estrogen  production.  Like formestane, <span style=" color: #393939;">it </span>takes several days after ceasing use for the body to recover its normal estrogen synthesizing capacity, which is the time required by the body to replenish its enzyme levels. It seems logical based on structure and action that the same thing occurs with testolactone.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Although testolactone is technically steroidal in structure, it offers no anabolic or androgenic effect to its user.This is because it does not possess the traits necessary to bind and activate the androgen receptor, namely an active 17- beta-hydroxyl group. In fact, its D ring is an unusual six­ membered  lactone  ring,  and  not  the  normal  five­ membered  carboxylic  ring  that  testosterone  and  its derivatives  normally  possess.  This  is  likely  where testolactone  got  its  name,  which  may  be  short  for testosterone-lactone.  Studies  actually  suggest  this steroidal drug possesses some level of anti-androgenic action, which likely occurs via competitive inhibition of the cellular  androgen  receptor  .  Regardless  of  this, testolactone has been included in the U.S. controlled substance list as an anabolic/androgenic steroid. For the purposes of this reference book it will remain classified as an anti-estrogenic drug. Likewise, testolactone is used by athletes and bodybuilders not to increase muscle mass and performance, but to mitigate the estrogenic side effects caused by certain anabolic/androgenic steroids.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that the level of aromatase inhibition produced with testolactone is significantly lower than that produced by the newer selective third generation inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. For example, one study conducted in 1985 showed that 1,000 mg of testolactone per day given to nine normal men for a period of ten days suppressed serum estradiol levels by 25% . Another using the same 1,000 mg dose noted a 50% reduction after six days of use . These numbers are lower than  what  would  be  expected  of  the  newer  third- generation  agents  given  the  substantial  estrogen suppression figures they have produced during clinical trials with women.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1654">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1655">Testolactone was first approved as a prescription drug by the FDA back in 1970. It was an early anti-estrogenic drug, exhibiting a moderately pronounced effect but failing to reach levels of high clinical success. As other more effective medications began to surface for the treatment of breast cancer,  testolactone  would  not  see  the  success  its developers likely planned for it. It would see production in a small number of countries outside the U.S., most notably Brazil,Germany,and Chile.lt has since been discontinued in all countries but the U.S., where the Teslac brand is still available.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1656">Testolactone is most commonly supplied in tablets of 50 mg.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1657">Testolactone is classified as a steroidal noncompetitive irreversible  steroidal  aromatase  inhibitor.

In 1999, the FDA officially added malaise to the list of possible side effects from <span style=" color: #393939;">this </span>drug, reflecting something bodybuilders had noticed for some time: low estrogen levels can lead to lethargy, as this sex hormone plays an important role in the functioning of the central nervous system. Aromatase inhibitors may also decrease bone mineral density, which may lead to osteoporosis and an increase in fractures in susceptible patients. Some individuals may also respond to the medication with gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting. Aromatase inhibitors can harm the development of an unborn fetus, and should never be taken or handled during pregnancy.

Studies have demonstrated that when an aromatizable steroid such as testosterone enanthate is taken in conjunction with testolactone, suppression of HDL (good) cholesterol levels becomes significantly more pronounced.   Since   the   estrogen   receptor agonist/antagonist Nolvadex® generally does not display the same anti-estrogenic (negative) effect on cholesterol values, it is usually favored over aromatase inhibitors for estrogen maintenance by male bodybuilders and athletes concerned with cardiovascular health.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Testolactone is FDA approved as adjunctive therapy in the palliative treatment of advanced or disseminated breast cancer  in  postmenopausal  women  when  hormonal therapy is indicated.

Its main clinical use is for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, or the hypersecretion of prolactin from lactotropes in the anterior pituitary (pituitary tumor is a common cause of this disorder).  It  is  also  applied  in  the  management  of Parkinson&#39;s  disease.  Cabergoline  effectively  inhibits prolactin secretion, which it does by mimicking the actions of dopamine on the D2 receptor (dopamine normally serves as negative feedback for prolactin release). As a targeted agonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, cabergoline should not affect other pituitary hormones like growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), corticotrophin (ACTH), or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Prolactin is a somatotropic hormone, in the same family as human  growth  hormone  (somatropin).  It  is  a  single peptide hormone, containing a chain of 199 amino acids. This makes it similar to (though slightly larger than) growth hormone, which is made of 192 amino acids. Any similarity between these two hormones, however, ends at structure. Prolactin is not an anabolic agent (at least not to skeletal muscle) but a lactation hormone. Most of its physiological value  is  in  women,  and  becomes  apparent  during pregnancy when it aids in milk production. Cabergoline, likewise,  is  sometimes  used  to  suppress  lactation postpartum if there is a particular medical need for it. In men, prolactin has no known therapeutic value, and high levels  are  associated  with  impotence,  infertility,  and sometimes even gynecomastia (whether or not it has a causative role here remains the subject of much debate).</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Although this is almost never associated with males, high levels of prolactin have actually been related to lactating gynecomastia in a very small percentage of steroid-using athletes. This disorder is often characterized by small fluid discharge that becomes noticeable with the squeezing of one’s gynecomastic nipple. Although the situation can become worse, the first sign of this is often enough to scare the individual away from their current regimen of steroids. Gynecomastia is not automatically (or even normally) associated with lactation, so this is a somewhat rare phenomenon.  It  is  probably  caused  by  an  unusual imbalance  of  hormones  (androgens,  estrogens,  and progestins can all be involved and play varying roles), and/or a particular personal sensitivity to the disorder. When it does occur, however, cabergoline has been looked</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">at as a remedy for the potentially embarrassing situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1661">High prolactin levels (as would be associated with the need for cabergoline) are not regularly documented in steroid- using  athletes,  further  underscoring  the  relative uncommon nature of this disorder.

It is used most commonly  as  a  prolactin  inhibitor  in  cases  of hyperprolactinemia, a growth hormone suppressant in acromegaly (high doses are required), and as an adjunctive medication to levodopa in the management of Parkinson&#39;s disease. The structure and activity of this drug are very similar  to  that  of  cabergoline  (Dostinex).  In  the athletic/bodybuilding  communities,  bromocriptine  is sometimes used to induce fat loss or combat elevated prolactin  levels  subsequent  to  anabolic/androgenic steroid use (a rare occurrence, sometimes marked by lactating gynecomastia).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The most vocal proponent of bromocriptine use for fat loss is probably Lyle McDonald, author of the online e-Book <i><b>Bromocriptine: An Old Drug With New Uses. </b></i>In this book McDonald describes how the drug can be used to normalize the metabolism, such that some of the normal physiological responses to dieting (which begin to slow the loss of body fat as the duration of dieting increases) are hindered. A lot of this focuses on leptin, a hormone looked at as sort of a fat thermostat, telling your brain how much adipose tissue you have on your body and how many calories you are regularly consuming (an &quot;anti-starvation&quot; hormone). Dieting tends to lower leptin levels significantly, which causes your body to respond in an appropriate way for survival (it tries to hold on to Its nutrient stores as much as possible). Maintaining normal leptin stimulation could be key to keeping any diet productive, and bromocriptine may indeed allow us to do that.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The human medical data concerning the potential role this drug  might  play  in  supporting  ongoing  fat  loss  is encouraging. In cases where it was given while dieting, bromocriptine was capable of increasing total fat loss by a statistically significant degree, and seemed to extend the duration in which the diet was most effective. In one case, both placebo and treatment groups were noticing a measurable fat loss during the first 6 weeks of calorie restriction.  Only  the  bromocriptine  group,  however, continued to lose significant amounts of weight for the remaining 12 weeks of intervention. Dieting plateau, or a point in which continued fat loss drastically slows or stops, is a common issue among those undertaking a calorie- restricted diet for the purpose of reducing body fat mass. A drug that can prevent or delay this plateau may logically be able to increase the overall effectiveness of dieting for many individuals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1668">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1669">Bromocriptine has been used widely in clinical medicine for its indicated used since the 1970s.

In the U.S., the most common brand name is Parlodel, which is sold by Novartis.The drug is available in dozens of countries, and is sold under a similarly large number of different trade names including (but not limited to) Bromed, Criten, Grifocriptina, Bromo-Kin, Pavidel, and Gynodel. Bromocriptine remains a common medication today  in  most  developed  nations  for  its  intended therapeutic uses.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Bromocriptine mesylate is most commonly supplied in tablets of 2.5 mg and 5 mg. The doses are expressed in terms of base bromocriptine, so each 2.5 mg tablet contains 2.87mg of bromocriptine mesylate.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1670">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1671">Bromocriptine mesylate is an ergot derivative with the chemical  designation  (5&#39;S)-2-bromo-12&#39;-hydroxy-2&#39;-(1- methylethyl)-5&#39;-(2-methylpropyl)-ergotaman-3&#39;,6&#39;,  18-trione methanesulphonate.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Side Effects:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bromocriptine can produce a number of unwanted side effects,  the most  notable being  low blood pressure, dizziness, confusion and nausea.These side effects do tend to be dose related, with the low recommended doses used in bodybuilding are not likely to be much trouble for many. Further, initial nausea sometimes goes away after a couple of applications, once the user becomes accustomed to the drug. However, the strong incidence of any unwelcome side  effects  should  warrant  discontinuing  therapy, especially  if  blood  pressure  is  becoming  negatively affected (too low a drop). Less common adverse reactions include anxiety, dry mouth, edema, seizures, fatigue, headache, lethargy, nasal congestion, rash, elevated liver</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">enzymes, and changes in urinary frequency.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1672">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1673">When used medically to treat disorders marked by hyperprolactinaemia (hyper secretion of prolactin), an initial dosage of 1.25 mg to 2.5 mg per day is usually recommended.This may be increased by 2.5 mg every 2-7 days  until  an  acceptable  therapeutic  dosage  is established.This may require taking as much as 20-30 mg per day. When used (off-label) to support fat loss, dieting individuals commonly take between 2.5 mg and 5 mg per day. This is given in a single morning dose, due to the relatively long half-life of the drug. This may be used in short dieting cycles, and should not be considered for long-term weight management. Similar dosing schedules are common when used by athletes and bodybuilders to counter lactating gynecomastia, although higher doses may be required in some instances. A 4-6 week course of therapy, combined with a rearrangement of offending steroids, is usually undertaken.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Bromocriptine is produced in most developed countries, including the United States where it is sold as a generic drug and underthe Parlodel brand name.The brand name product comes in the form of both 2.5 mg tablets and 5 mg capsules, with 100 doses per bottle.

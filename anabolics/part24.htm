Like  other amphetamine derivatives, it is categorized as an anorectic (appetite suppressing) agent. Phentermine is commonly prescribed as a weight loss aid in obese patients. It is typically used for short periods of time (less than 12 weeks), and as an adjunct to support an ongoing exercise and dieting regimen.The main focus is to curb the desire to eat, thereby reducing the total caloric intake. Although the data seems to vary from trial to trial, much of it supports at least a modest additional loss of </a><span style=" color: #393939;">fat </span>mass with the use of phentermine  hydrochloride.<span class="s33">1  </span>Athletes  and  bodybuilders use phentermine hydrochloride for the same purpose, typically  when  weight  loss  is  required  for  physique remodeling or competition.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1755">Phentermine hydrochloride was first introduced to the U.S. drug market in the 1970s. Base phentermine was available in the U.S. as far back as 1959. Phentermine had long been used as an appetite suppressant, although the most notable attention to it came in the early 1990s, when the drug was successfully paired with fenfluramine during diet studies. Investigators had shown that this type of drug combination was actually more effective at promoting weight loss than diet and exercise, results that quickly catapulted Fen-Phen into top place in the prescription weight loss drug market. By 1997, however, it had become apparent that a very high percentage of Fen-Phen users were noticing heart valve defects as a result of the drugs. Fenfluramine was identified as the principle cause, and was withdrawn  from  the  U.S.  market  that  same  year. Phentermine remains available in the U.S. and many nations abroad today. Popular trade names include Adipex, lonamin, Anoxine, Phentrol, and Obenix. Note that as an amphetamine derivative, this medication has a tendency to be habit forming. For this reason it has been added to the U.S. controlled substances list as a schedule IV medication.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1756">Phentermine hydrochloride is most commonly supplied in tablets and capsules of 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg each.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Phentermine hydrochloride is a central stimulant and indirect-acting  sympathomimetic  of  the  amphetamine family.

Less common side effects  include  vision  disturbances,  reduced  libido, confusion,  diarrhea,  dizziness,  dry  mouth,  headache, irregular heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, rash, and tiredness. Phentermine is a CNS stimulant with potential for fatal overdose. Signs of overdose may include rapid breathing, fever, hallucinations, blood pressure irregularities, irregular heartbeat,  unconsciousness,  trembling,  shaking,  panic, extreme restlessness, and severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Administration:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">For  optimal  effectiveness,  phentermine  hydrochloride should not be taken with food.The usual adult dose is one capsule or tablet (37.5 mg) daily, administered before or 1- 2 hours after breakfast. For some patients a half of a tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in other cases it may be advisable to give a half of a tablet (18.75 mg) twice daily. When taken more than once per day, the second dose should never be taken within 4-6 hours of sleep.The drug is typically used for 3-4 weeks at a time, with longer durations  of  therapy  rarely  exceeding  12  weeks. Bodybuilders and athletes typically use the prescribed amount of drug in a similar short-term fashion, due to the high likelihood of side effects as the dose escalates beyond the normal therapeutic range.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1759">Availability:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Phentermine hydrochloride is available in a number of different countries.

Unlike clenbuterol, however, albuterol is readily available as a prescription drug in the United States. It is also sold as salbutamol in a number of other countries, which is another generic name for the drug. Albuterol is most commonly found in the form of a rescue inhaler, which is designed to disperse a measured amount of the drug immediately and directly to the bronchial tubes in times of crisis (asthma attack).This form provides the least amount of systemic drug activity possible, which is great for minimizing  unwanted  cardiovascular  side  effects. Albuterol oral tablets are also available, however, and provide a systemic dose of the drug.These are the subject of interest in the bodybuilding and athletic communities, and they can provide significant beta-2 stimulation and measurable fat loss throughout the body given the right conditions. Note that a more comprehensive discussion of the benefits, activities, and side effects of beta-2 agonist drugs can be found under the clenbuterol drug profile.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1761">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1762">Albuterol sulfate was introduced to the U.S. drug market in 1980, sold under the Ventolin brand name. Albuterol sulfate has grown to be one of the most popular drugs in history for the management of acute asthma attacks. As a result, many other companies have invested in the market. The Ventrolin brand name is still available in the U.S., however, the FDA has also approved a variety of other generic and brand name forms of the drug. Albuterol sulfate is also presently sold in both inhalation and oral preparations in most developed countries. Popular trade names  include  Aerolin,  Airomir,  Asmasal,  Asthalin, Asthavent, Asmol, Butahale, Buventol, ProAir, Proventil, Salamol, Sultanol, and Volmax.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1763">Albuterol sulfate is most commonly supplied in oral metered dose inhalers and tablets of 2 mg, </a><span style=" color: #393939;">4 </span>mg, or 8 mg each.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Albuterol sulfate (salbutamol sulphate) is a short-acting ,2- adrenergic receptor agonist.

Less common but more serious adverse events include allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling of the lips,tongue,or face.or difficulty breathing),chest pain, high blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat. Albuterol sulfate is a CNS stimulant with potential for fatal overdose. Signs of overdose may include rapid breathing, blood pressure irregularities,  irregular  heartbeat,  unconsciousness, trembling, shaking, panic, extreme restlessness, and severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1765">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The usual starting dosage for adults and children 12 years and older for the management of asthma is 2-4 mg three or four times per day. When used (off-label) for fat loss, an effective dose of albuterol usually starts in the range of one to two 4 mg tablets per day (1 tablet X 1-2 applications). This is often increased slightly as the user becomes accustomed to the drug, perhaps to 4 mg three to four times per day. Individuals very sensitive to the stimulant side effects of beta agonists usually start with the lower- dose 2mg tablets first. The administration intervals are spread out as evenly as possible, so as to prevent overlap and sustain active concentrations in the blood for as much of the day as possible. Athletesand bodybuilders will often use their body temperature as a marker of drug efficacy. A degree or two elevation in temperature with use of the drug may indicate that lipolysis (the removal of stored fatty acids in adipose tissue) is being effectively stimulated.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">As is noted with all beta agonists, tolerance to the thermogenic  benefits  of  this  drug  tends  to  develop quickly. This is usually noticed by the body temperature returning to normal pretreated levels. Due to the potential side effects of these drugs, it is not advised to continually increase the dosage in order to chase down a diminishing effect. Instead, the user will usually opt to discontinue the</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">drug for some time (4 weeks or longer) to let the body restore   its   normal   beta-adrenergic   receptor concentrations. More recently, the antihistamine Zaditen (ketotifen)  has  become  popular,  which  is  a  potent upregulator of beta-adrenergic receptors, especially beta-</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1766">2  receptors.

These drugs affect that sympathetic nervous system in a wide number of ways, largely mediated by the distribution of adrenoceptors. There are actually nine different types of these receptors in the body, which are classified as either alpha or beta and further subcategorized  by  type  number.  Depending  on  the specific affinities of these agents for the various receptors, they can potentially be used in the treatment of conditions such  as  asthma,  hypertension,  cardiovascular  shock,</p><p style="padding-left: 34pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: justify;">arrhythmias, migraine headaches and anaphylactic shock.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">exhibits an extremely long half-life in the body, which is measured to be approximately 34 hours long .This makes steady blood levels easy to achieve, requiring only a single</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">The text <i><b>Goodman and Gillman&#39;s The Pharmacological Basis </b></i><span class="s185">or twice daily dosing schedule at most .

Of particular interest is the fact that this drug has little beta-1 stimulating activity. Since beta-1 receptors are closely tied to the cardiac effects of these agents, this allows clenbuterol hydrochloride to reduce reversible airway obstruction (an effect of beta-2 stimulation) with much less cardiovascular side effects compared to non-selective beta agonists. Clinical studies with  this  drug  show  it  is  extremely  effective  as  a bronchodilator, with a low level of user complaints and high patient compliance . Clenbuterol hydrochloride also</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">strength and muscle mass. But as was well pointed out by a review published in the August 1995 issue of <i><b>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, </b></i>the possible anabolic results in humans are very questionable, and based only on animal data using much larger doses than would be required for bronchodilation .With such reports there has been a lot of debate as to whether or not clenbuterol hydrochloride is really anabolic in humans at all. Some seem to swear by the fact that it builds muscle, and use clenbuterol hydrochloride regularly as an off-season or adjunct  anabolic.  To  others,  the  MSSE  report  is confirmation that athletes have wasted valuable time and money on drugs that do not build muscle.The debate over clenbuterol  hydrochloride&#39;s  potential  anabolic  activity continues today.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1768">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clenbuterol  hydrochloride  has  been  available  as  a bronchodilator for decades and is widely used in many parts of the world. Although it has a good safety record and approval  in  a  wide  number  of other  countries,  this compound has never been made available for human use in the United States. The fact that there are a number of</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">similar effective asthma medications already approved by the FDA and available may have something to do with this, as a prospective drug firm would likely not find it a profitable enough product to warrant undergoing the expense of the new drug approval process. Regardless of this fact, foreign clenbuterol hydrochloride preparations are popular among U.S. bodybuilders and athletes, and today are widely available on the black market. Note that in recent years, clenbuterol overdose/poisoning has been reported in a number of people, striking up a great deal of controversy about the safety of this drug and its off-label use for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1769">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Clenbuterol hydrochloride is most commonly supplied in oral tablets of 20mcg each.

These side effects will generally subside after a week or so of use, once the user becomes accustomed to the drug. Clenbuterol hydrochloride is a CNS stimulant with potential for fatal overdose. Signs of overdose may include rapid breathing, blood  pressure  irregularities,  irregular  heartbeat, unconsciousness,  trembling,  shaking,  panic,  extreme restlessness, and severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1771">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used for the management of asthma, the most common clinical dose for adults is 20mcg (1 tablet) twice per day. Some patients require up to 40mcg (2 tablets) twice per day. When using the drug (off-label) for physique-   or   performance-enhancing   purposes, bodybuilders and athletes generally tailor their dosage and cycling of this product based on personal sensitivity to its benefits and side effects. To accomplish this, one often begins a cycle by taking one or two tablets per day, and gradually increasing the dosage every third day by one half to 1 tablet until a desired dosage range is established. At peak therapy some users can tolerate as many as 6-8 tablets per day (120-160mcg). Given the potency and potential for serious side effects, however, any dosage outside of the normal therapeutic range</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">should be approached with an even greater level of caution.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The drug will usually elevate the body temperature shortly after therapy is initiated.The rise in temperature is commonly .5 to 1 degree, sometimes a little more. This elevation is due to one&#39;s body burning excess energy (largely from fat), and is usually not uncomfortable. The number of consecutive days clenbuterol hydrochloride is now used is usually dependent on the response of the individual.To be clear, the athletic benefits of this drug will only last for a limited time and then diminish, largely due to  beta-receptor  downregulation.  By  most  accounts clenbuterol  hydrochloride  seems  to  work  well  for approximately 4 to 6 weeks. During this period, users generally monitor their body temperature on a regular basis. We are given some level of assurance that clenbuterol hydrochloride is working by the temperature elevation. Once the temperature drops back to normal, receptor downregulation has probably diminished the efficacy of the drug. At this point increasing the dosage is usually not regarded as effective, and instead clenbuterol hydrochloride is discontinued for a period of no less than 4-6 weeks.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1772">Many bodybuilding competitors enhance the fat burning effect  of  clenbuterol  hydrochloride  with  the  use  of additional substances. Many have commented that when the drug is combined with thyroid hormones, specifically the  powerful  Cytomel®,  the  thermogenic  effect  can become extremely dramatic. Such a mix is often further used during a steroid cycle, helping the individual elicit a much  more  toned  physique  from  the  drugs.  A cienbuterol/thyroid  mix  is  also  common  when  using growth hormone, which is believed to enhance the thermogenic and anabolic effect of HGH therapy. Lastly, ketotifen has also been a popular adjunct to clenbuterol hydrochloride, which is an antihistamine that upregulates beta-2 receptor density. It seems capable of not only increasing the potency of each dose of clenbuterol hydrochloride (allowing the user to take less clenbuterol), but  also  of  perhaps  even  slowing  receptor downregulation (see the Ketotifen profile for a more comprehensive discussion).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Clenbuterol hydrochloride is readily available on the international market. Although it is usually a very cheap drug in common source countries, allowing black market dealers ample opportunity to obtain legitimate drugs to divert for sale, clenbuterol hydrochloride has been the subject of low-level counterfeiting. A few things are important to note:</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Clenbuterol hydrochloride is not produced in the U.S., so</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">avoid anything bearing a U.S. company name.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Clenbuterol hydrochloride should only be trusted when found with a proper brand name from a foreign drug maker.

Specifically, it is both an alpha and beta adrenergic agonist (you may remember clenbuterol is a selective beta-2 agonist). In addition,  ephedrine  enhances  the  release  of norepinephrine, a strong endogenous alpha agonist. The action of this compound is notably similar to that of the body&#39;s  primary  adrenergic  hormone  epinephrine (adrenaline), which also exhibits action toward both alpha and beta receptors. When administered, ephedrine will notably increase the activity of the central nervous system, as well as have a stimulatory effect on other target cells. This may produce some effects that can be beneficial to a bodybuilder  or athlete.  For starters,  the user&#39;s body temperature should rise slightly as more free fatty acids are produced from the breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue (stimulating metabolism). This may aid in body fat reductions and increased vascularity. It is also believed that the anabolic effectiveness of steroids might be increased with this substance (mildly), as an increase in metabolic rate may equate to an increase in fat, protein and carbohydrate conversion by the body.The stimulant effect of this drug will also increase the force of skeletal muscle contractions.</a></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ephedrine is a fairly old medication, and has been used in the United States for a number of medical applications over the years including that of a stimulant, appetite suppressant,  decongestant,  and  hypotension  treatment associated with anesthesia.Today, it is approved as an over- the-counter medicine, and sales are largely found in this sector. Controls over ephedrine in the United States are growing in recent years, however, due to the fact that it can be used as a primary base for the manufacture of methamphetamine. With ephedrine available as an over- the-counter  product,  underground  manufacturers  have been able to easily obtain it. A trend involving large volume retail purchases for OTC ephedrine products had been developing,  and  many  states  have  responded  with legislation controlling the sale of precursor materials like ephedrine. In 2006, a federal law was passed further restricting the record keeping requirements and available sale channels for ephedrine in the Unites States. With the widespread increase of methamphetamine addiction (and related crime), some speculate ephedrine may soon join the list of federally controlled substances. In spite of tighter regulations, it is still presently available for over-the- counter sale.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1775">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1776">Ephedrine  (as  ephedrine  hydrochloride  or  ephedrine sulfate) is most commonly supplied in tablets of 25 mg or 50 mg each.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1777">Ephedrine  is  a  sympathomimetic  amine  related  in structure to amphetamine and methamphetamine.

For starters, the stimulant  effect  can  produce  shaky  hands,  tremors, sweating, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and feelings of inner unrest. Often these effects subside as the user becomes more accustomed to the effect of this drug, or perhaps the dosage is lowered. In general, those negatively impacted by caffeine would probably not like the stronger effects <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>ephedrine.The mental and physical state produced by this drug is also quite similar to that seen with clenbuterol, so those who find little discomfort with that treatment should (presumably) be fine with this item (and vice versa). While taking this drug one may also endure a notable loss of appetite, usually a welcome effect when dieting. Ephedrine is in fact a popular ingredient in combination (prescription) appetite  suppressants.  The  user  may  further  notice headaches and an increase in blood pressure with regular use  of  ephedrine.  Those  suffering  from  thyroid dysfunctions, high blood pressure, or cardiac irregularities should also not be taking this drug, as it will certainly not mix well with such conditions. Ephedrine is a CNS stimulant with potential for fatal overdose. Signs of overdose may include  rapid  breathing,  blood  pressure  irregularities, irregular heartbeat, unconsciousness, trembling, shaking, panic,extreme restlessness,and severe nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s172" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1778">Administration:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The  <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">primary  application  for  ephedrine  among bodybuilders and athletes (off-label) is that of a cutting (fat-loss) agent. Here, the individual will generally take this </span>drug <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">a </span>few times per day during a <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">dieting </span>phase of <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">training, at a dosage of 25 to 50 mg per application. The widely touted stack of ephedrine (25-50 mg), caffeine (200 mg), and aspirin (300 mg) (E/C/A) is shown to be </span>extremely potent <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">for </span>fat <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">loss, </span>and <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">is more commonly applied than ephedrine alone. In this combination, the ephedrine and caffeine both act as notable thermogenic stimulants.  The  added  aspirin  also  helps  to  inhibit </span>lipogenesis by blocking <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">the incorporation of acetate into </span>fatty <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">acids. </span>The <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">athlete may use an increase in body temperature as a marker that the drug combination is working.  This  is  usually  a  degree  or  so  (not  an </span>uncomfortable <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">raise). This combination is taken 2 to 3 times  daily,  for  several  consecutive  weeks.  It  is discontinued once the user&#39;s body temperature drops back to normal, a clear sign these drugs are no longer working as </span>desired. A break <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">of at least 4-6 weeks is usually </span>taken <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">so that this stack </span>may <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">once again work at an optimal level.</span></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1779">Ephedrine is also used by some competitive athletes (including </a><span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">powerlifters) as a stimulant before workouts </span>or competitions. The resulting (slight) strength and energy increase may improve anaerobic performance and weight totals on major lifts. On this same note, it is also believed <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">by some to provide </span>a <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">mental edge, making </span>the <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">user </span>more energetic <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">and </span>better able to concentrate on the tasks ahead. A pre-event dose of 25-50 mg of ephedrine is typically used for this purpose. It is important to note that <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">this compound </span>is <span style=" color: #5E5E5E;">not used continuously </span>as a pre-workout or pre-event stimulant, as its effect will diminish as the body becomes accustomed to the drug.

Sibutramine hydrochloride is not advertised as a rapid acting drug, but instead one that fosters slow, safe, and steady losses in fat mass which are maintained long-term.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Sibutramine  hydrochloride  exerts  a  weight-loss  effect through two distinct mechanisms. It has a marked ability to suppress appetite. During some studies, patients would reduce their daily energy intake by as much as 1,300 calories while taking this drug.<span class="s33">1 </span>In addition to its effects on caloric intake, sibutramine also stimulates metabolism and daily caloric expenditure. A single 10 mg dose has been demonstrated to increase basal metabolic rate by up to 30%, an effect that is maintained for at least six hours.This thermogenic action is known to occur via the adrenergic system, mainly through the indirect support of beta 3 receptor activation. With the use of this drug, we are specifically seeing a strong increase in brown adipose tissue thermogenesis (BAT), which is accompanied by body temperature increases of .5 - 1 degree Celsius.<span class="s33">2 </span>Elevated body temperature is a good indicator that thermogenesis is being triggered, which you may recall as one of the key things we are looking for when taking clenbuterol.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1781">To get a better idea of exactly how well sibutramine hydrochloride works, we refer to some of the clinical studies on this agent. One investigation was conducted at the Kansas Foundation for Clinical Pharmacology in 2001. Here, a group of 322 obese patients were given either 20 mg of sibutramine or placebo once daily for 24 weeks. By the conclusion of this study, 42% of patients in the sibutramine group lost 5% or more of their initial body weight, while 12% noticed a 10% or greater loss in body weight. Sibutramine was also associated with significant improvements in serum triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, which were displaying poor values at the onset of the study.

When used for asthma, the drug is not regarded as effective for treating an immediate attack (it is not a rapid  bronchodilator).  Instead,  over  time  its  use  is associated with a reduction in the frequency, duration, and severity of attacks. It is usually prescribed as a way to increase  the  efficacy  of  other  asthma  medications. Likewise, ketotifen fumarate will usually supplement an existing asthma medication program, and not replace the prescribing of immediate rescue devices such as an asthma inhaler or nebuliser.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ketotifen  fumarate  alleviates  allergy  symptoms  by blocking  histamine  H1  receptors,  a  property  that  is common to drugs ofthe antihistamine class. Its second and very unique mode of action, however, makes it useful in the treatment  asthma.  Ketotifen  fumarate  increases  the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in the body (especially beta-2 receptors). Drugs that stimulate beta-2 receptors are commonly prescribed as bronchodilators, used to increase airflow to the lungs and counter the constriction  caused  by  asthma.  While  potentially efficacious alone, one key therapeutic effect of ketotifen fumarate is to increase the sensitivity ofthe body to drugs of the beta agonist class.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The beta-2 receptor upregulating properties of ketotifen fumarate make this drug of interest to the bodybuilding and athletic communities.This is due to the strong role of the beta-2 receptor in supporting fat loss. Although not a strong fat loss compound by itself, when taken with a beta-</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">2 agonist thermogenic like clenbuterol, ketotifen fumarate may increase thermogenic potency and noticeably extend the window of active lipolysis. Clenbuterol and other beta- 2 agonists normally have a limited duration of usefulness here because beta-2-adrenergic receptors decrease in number with regular stimulation. Within several weeks of initiating therapy with such a drug, it usually begins to diminish in effectiveness. Ketotifen may extend this time period considerably.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">The ability of ketotifen to potentiate the effects of beta-2 agonist drugs has been demonstrated in a number of clinical studies. For example, one study published in 1990 demonstrated that when ketotifen and clenbuterol were taken together, there was a significant increase in beta- adrenergic receptor density compared to the use of clenbuterol  alone,  which  again  decreases  beta adrenoceptor density fairly quickly.<span class="s33">1 </span>Other studies with</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">salbutamol (also referred to generically as albuterol) showed that beta adrenoceptor downregulation caused by long-term use of this beta-adrenergic agent could be rapidly reversed with as little as 2mg of ketotifen fumarate per day.<span class="s33">2</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1788">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ketotifen was globalized as a prescription medication by Novartis, it is presently prescribed for allergies, allergic conditions, and (most commonly) the management of asthma in more than three-dozen countries around the world. <span style=" color: #393939;">The </span>most widely available brand name is Novartis&#39; Zaditen, which is sold throughout most parts of Europe and Asia. In addition to generic forms of the medication, dozens of other brand names can be found in many different markets as well. Ketotifen fumarate is approved <span style=" color: #393939;">for </span>sale in the United States, but currently only as an ophthalmic  anti-allergy  solution  (Zaditor),  not  an  oral allergy/asthma  medication.  The  dosage  of  ketotifen fumarate in this product is also too low for it to be considered useful for any other (off label) purpose. Given the  ready  availability  of  ketotifen  fumarate  in  other countries, the drug is easily diverted for black market sale.

There is admittedly conflicting data on the potential usefulness of ketotifen fumarate for this purpose, with some studies reporting positive results and others showing an insignificant effect. A thorough review of the data published on the Cochrane Database of systematic Reviews in 2004 concluded that it appeared to have some usefulness in controlling asthma and wheezing in many children, but the variability of the disease and response to the drug meant that these positive results could not be generalized for all asthma patients.<span class="s33">3</span></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1789">How Supplied:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ketotifen fumarate is most commonly supplied in tablets</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1790">of 1 mg.

If necessary, this may be increased to a maximum dosage of 2mg twice per day (4mg total). Bodybuilders and athletes will commonly use a dosage of <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">1 </span>mg twice per day (2mg total) for  the  (off-label)  use  of  preventing  receptor downregulation with clenbuterol or other beta-agonists. This  may  allow  an  individual  to  obtain  a  strong thermogenic effect from, and run longer cycles with, beta- 2 agonist drugs. Note that given its ability to increase drug sensitivity, the dosage of beta-2 agonist medications may need  to  be  reduced  upon  ketotifen  fumarate administration.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Ketotifen fumarate is widely available, and is sold under numerous brand names <span style=" color: #7A7A7A;">in </span>many countries.

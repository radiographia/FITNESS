It  acts  by competitively inhibiting aldosterone binding to receptor sites, especially in the renal tubes where aldosterone is involved in sodium-potassium exchange. The drug causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted and potassium to be retained. This is different from some other agents of this class, such as a loop diuretic like furosemide, which can significantly increase the excretion of  sodium,  water,  and  potassium.  In  this  light, spironolactone is commonly referred to as a &quot;potassium sparing&quot; diuretic. It is used medically for a number of conditions including the treatment of high blood pressure, edema   related   to   congestive   heart   failure, hyeraldosteronism (the over production of aldosterone), and hypokalemia (drop of potassium, often associated with other medical interventions). Spironolactone is often used (off-label) by competitive athletes and bodybuilders to make short-term adjustments in water weight. The primary focus is to bring about increased muscle definition by shedding subcutaneous water (bodybuilders), or to make  category  adjustments  during  the  weigh-in procedure  in  sports  with  restricted  weight  classes (athletes).</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">History:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1694">Spironolactone was developed during the late 1950s, and first saw widespread use in clinical medicine during the early 1960s.The drug filled an important need for a diuretic that does not deplete potassium, and therefore has a less dramatic impact on electrolyte balance in the body. In many regards it is looked at as a &quot;safer&quot; and &quot;milder&quot; diuretic compared to other agents in this general category, such as loop diuretics or thiazides, allowing this agent room for market stability and success. Today, spironolactone is widely  distributed  throughout  most  of  the  developed world. It is available in dozens of brand names, the most commonly identified is probably Aldactone from Searle. It is  also  widely  sold  in  mixed-ingredient  preparations alongside other diuretics.This includes furosemide, as seen in  the  product  Lasilacton,  or  hydrochlorothiazide,  in Searle&#39;s (also widely distributed) mixed diuretic product Aldactazide.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Spironolactone is most commonly supplied in tablets of 25 mg.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s163" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1695">Structural Characteristics:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1696">Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and diuretic.

Diuretics may produce a life-threatening level of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance when administered without proper medical supervision. Many deaths have been associated with the misuse of these drugs. It is also important to note that the supplementation of potassium, either through pharmaceuticals or a diet rich in potassium, is generally not advised while taking a potassium-sparing diuretic like spironolactone. Excessive potassium intake may cause hyperkalemia, which may lead to cardiac irregularities and possibly death.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1697">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Adverse  reactions  associated  with  spironolactone administration  may  include  gynecomastia,  cramping, diarrhea, drowsiness, lethargy, headache, skin irritation, rash, mental confusion, fever, impotence, loss of muscle coordination,  menstrual  irregularities,  virilization,  and deepening of the voice. Spironolactone has also been shown to cause tumors in rats. Breast cancer has been reported in some patients receiving spironolactone, but no causal relationship has yet been established. Additionally, this compound may exhibit anti-androgenic properties, as both a weak inhibitor of androgen/receptor binding and testosterone biosynthesis.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1698">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">When used medically to treat hypertension, the initial recommended dosage in adults is 50 mg to 100 mg per day in divided doses. It may take two weeks for a maximum response to be achieved.The dosage may be adjusted later depending on the individual needs of the patient. When</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">used (off-label) by male bodybuilders to increase muscle definition or athletes to reduce weight before a weigh-in, a dosage of 100 mg per day in a single morning application, is most common.This may be continued for 3 to 5 days prior to the event, and will often result in a harder and more defined appearance to the muscles (or substantial  reduction  in  body  weight  prior  to rehydration).</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Women are occasionally attracted to spironolactone for its effect as an anti-androgen. It is sometimes used as a safety net at a point when androgen levels have become problematic during a cycle, and is used in an effort to reduce the risk of permanent virilization symptoms. A dosage of 25-75 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks is often used for this purpose, and may be enough to ward off side effects while  androgen  levels  decline  (the  steroid  regimen terminated). Since spironolactone is more effective at lowering endogenous  androgen  levels than inhibiting androgen action, it is certainly not to be considered a cure-all remedy for adventurous steroid-using female athletes.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Since this compound is one of the mildest (prescription) diuretic options, it is a common starting point for an early competitor. Once familiar with its effects, many attempt to achieve  a  stronger  level  of  water  loss  by  mixing spironolactone with a thiazide or furosemide (Lasix). The goal is to provide strong water excretion with less calcium/potassium loss than using the stronger diuretics alone. When mixed with hydrochlorothiazide,for example, the 100 mg spironolactone dosage is often cut in half, and an equal amount of the thiazide is taken. The 50 mg/50 mg combination is reported to noticeably increase water excretion without dramatic side effects.The potassium re­ absorption seen with spironolactone should be balanced out with the thiazide so potassium levels will not be as greatly affected. On the other hand, Lasix (furosemide) should make an even stronger addition to spironolactone. In this case, dropping the spironolactone dosage to 50 mg and adding 20 mg oral Lasix is a popular choice, and is often said to provide the water-shedding effect that is roughly equivalent to a 40 mg Lasix tablet. Again, the potassium depleting effect of Lasix may be offset to some degree by the potassium sparing effect of spironolactone, so  additional  potassium  supplements  are  not  likely necessary. Many such combination diuretics are widely available, and appear to be well regarded in clinical circles.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is important to note that while Lasix and Hydrodiuril appear to be more effective at inducing short-term water loss, they also have increased risks as compared to potassium-sparing diuretics, and should be approached with caution.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1699">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Spironolactone is widely manufactured in both single ingredient and multi-ingredient drug preparations.

Edema may occur without known cause (idiopathic edema), or be associated with liver or kidney disease, congestive heart failure, corticosteroid/progestin use, or the  overproduction  of  aldosterone.  Triamterene  is classified as a potassium sparing diuretic, increasing the rate  of  water  and  sodium  excretion  but  preserving potassium levels. As the name suggests, this drug produces a pronounced diuretic effect without the potassium loss associated with thiazides/loop diuretics. The need for potassium supplementation is, therefore, eliminated with this agent. The diuretic activity following a single dose of triamterene is usually evident within 2 to 4 hours, reaching peak effect at approximately 3 hours in most cases. Its diuretic effect lasts for a total of 7-9 hours following administration.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Triamterene is utilized (off-label) by bodybuilders and athletes  to  shed  subcutaneous  water  prior  to  a bodybuilding  competition,  or  to  make  weight  class adjustments in certain competitive sports. Bodybuilders in particular rely heavily on the increased definition that can result when water retention is reduced.The highly defined &quot;shredded&quot; physique common to bodybuilding today is nearly impossible to achieve without the use of diuretics. At the same time, diuretics are the reason weight class competitors like wrestlers and boxers often appear much heavier during an event than they do at the weigh-in. A considerable amount of body weight (in the form of water) can be removed with diuretic use, often resulting in a drop of one or more weight categories. This practice is very common in sports where the user is not drug tested and has ample time to rehydrate following a weigh-in, resulting in the athlete competing at a significantly heavier weight than his or her weight class would dictate.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1701">History:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Triamterene first saw extensive clinical use during the 1960s.lt was used largely as a standalone agent at first, but went on to become a widely used agent in clinical medicine  in  combination  products  with  other  diuretic drugs. Today this usually includes other, more potent diuretics  like  thiazides  and  loop  agents.  Here,  the potassium loss of the stronger diuretic is balanced to some degree by the potassium sparing triamterene, which often results in a reduced or even eliminated need for potassium supplementation  during  therapy.

Among bodybuilders, this drug is commonly used for only a few days prior to a competition, adjusting the dosage over the course to elicit the best level of diuretic effect. Since it has a long lasting action, it is generally administered once per day. One capsule (100 mg) is usually taken the first thing in the morning with a meal, and the effect judged over the next several hours. The dosage is usually increased by one capsule per day for 2-3 days at most, until the user is noticing the proper water loss for competition. When looking for a stronger diuretic effect, many bodybuilders and athletes will opt to combine triamterene with another stronger  diuretic  such  as  hydrochlorthiazide  or furosemide.The dosage of both agents would be adjusted downward to compensate for their combined effects.The goal here is usually to increase short-term diuresis, without causing the extreme potassium loss that can be associated with the use of thiazides or loop diuretics alone at higher doses.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Availability:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Triamterene is widely sold throughout the developed world.

In comparison to other diuretics, Hydrodiuril is stronger than the potassium sparing agent Aldactone® (spironolactone), but weaker then <span style=" color: #393939;">the </span>loop agent Lasix (furosemide). While potassium excretion is much less pronounced than that seen with Lasix, the use of a potassium supplement (or a potassium rich diet) may still be necessary with this product. This is usually dependent on the dose and duration in which the drug is administered. Calcium excretion may also be pronounced with thiazides, but again, are weaker in this regard than Lasix.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">The use of diuretics has been increasingly popular in a number of athletic disciplines. For starters, these drugs are very popular among bodybuilders who use them to shed subcutaneous water before a competition. The ability to have a winning physique often relies heavily on the definition that can result from diuretic use. The highly defined, super hard and shredded look common today in this sport is nearly impossible to achieve without the use of these drugs. Many athletes competing in sports with weight categories also utilize diuretics. Wrestlers and boxers, for example, might use diuretics to compete in a heavier weight class than would be dictated by an earlier weigh-in measurement. Given that the weight-in is usually done a day (or many hours) before a competition, the athlete can reduce water weight with diuretics, yet have enough time to restore fluids and bodyweight before the event. The result can be a shift of one or more weight categories, which can be a formidable advantage in these types sports.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1709">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Hydrochlorothiazide was developed during the 1950s.

A combination of a potassium sparing diuretic like Aldactone® (spironolactone) and Hydrodiuril is regarded as particularly useful by many, and is believed to slightly balance out the calcium and potassium  loss  associated  with  the  use  of hydrochlorothiazide.The dosage of each agent would be reduced considerably, usually starting with a 25 mg/25 mg application and working upwards.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">It is important to note that the overuse <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>diuretics, aside from being potentially very dangerous, may result in too much water loss. This can lead to flat, &quot;deflated&quot; looking muscles. A higher diuretic dosage, likewise, does not always equate to increased definition and muscularity.lt is usually regarded as good advice by those in the athletic community to become familiar with the practice of using diuretics before using them during competition time. Otherwise, the user may be left to make frantic dosage adjustments at the last minute, which can be a dangerous and ineffective practice.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1714">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Hydrochlorothiazide  is  widely  manufactured  in  both single ingredient and multi-ingredient drug preparations.

They are used most commonly to treat edema and high blood pressure. Like other agents of this type, furosemide works by inhibiting the Na-K-2CI symporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle, which is a carrier protein that pulls sodium, potassium, and chloride inside cells. This mode of action is independent of any inhibition towards aldosterone.  Loop  diuretics  are  among the strongest diuretics available, and can have an extremely dramatic effect on fluid and electrolyte levels in the body. Potassium levels need to be closely watched in particular, and patients  may  require  a  prescription  potassium supplement. If the proper levels of potassium and other electrolytes  are  not  maintained,  serious  heart complications may develop. Mistakes in potassium dosage have equally serious consequences; so it is of note that furosemide can be a particularly risky item to use without proper medical supervision.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Athletes and bodybuilders use diuretics for a couple of specific purposes, and usually for only brief periods. Competitive  athletes  in  sports  with  weight  class restrictions may use these drugs to drop water weight, in an effort to make adjustments in their weight class standings. Since the weigh-in procedure is often a day or days before a competition, one can drop their bodyweight considerably with diuretics, and be back to normal within hours after drug cessation and rehydration. This may provide a strong competitive advantage, allowing the athlete to compete at a heavier weight than his or her category would dictate. This advantage is only offset to some degree by the now near universal nature of some form  of  &quot;dropping  weight&quot;  practice  in  these  sports. Bodybuilders may rely heavily on diuretics when preparing for a contest. Here, a drug like furosemide can efficiently lower  subcutaneous  water  concentrations,  helping  to produce  a  more  defined  (&quot;ripped&quot;)  look  common  to competitive bodybuilding.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1717">History:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furosemide was developed during the early 1960s. Much of the initial research on this diuretic was conducted in Europe, mainly Germany and Italy. The drug proved to be quite successful, however, and within a matter of years gained  worldwide  attention  and  acceptance  as  a treatment for edema and high blood pressure. Over the years, furosemide preparations have become among the most popular medications in their area of medicine.

The most recognized brand name is Lasix, presently sold in the U.S. and many other nations under the Sanofi Aventis label.The actual number of different brand and generic forms of furosemide would be difficult to calculate and list, but would probably measure in the hundreds.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How Supplied:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Furosemide is most commonly supplied in oral tablets of</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1719">20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, and injectable solutions containing 10 mg/ml.</a></p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Structural Characteristics:</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark1720">Furosemide is an anthranilic acid derived loop diuretic.

The misuse of diuretic drug(s) like furosemide  for  physique-  or  performance-enhancing purposes is characterized as a high-risk practice. Diuretics may produce a life-threatening level of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance when administered without proper medical supervision. Many deaths have been associated with the misuse of these drugs.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1721">Side Effects:</a></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furosemide  use  may  be  associated  with  electrolyte imbalance. This may include the depletion of potassium (hypokalemia),  sodium  (hyponatremia),  magnesium (hypomagnesemia), and calcium (hypocalcemia), as well as hypochloremic alkalosis, an increase in blood bicarbonate due  to  significant  chloride  loss.  Signs  of  electrolyte imbalance include dry mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pain, muscle cramping, seizures, reduced urine volume, low blood pressure, and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">gastrointestinal  disturbances.  Other  side  effects  may include pancreatitisjaundice, anorexia, oral and stomach irritation,  cramping,  diarrhea,  constipation,  nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, numbness or tingling of the extremities, vertigo, dizziness, headache, blurred vision or other visual disturbances, anemia, decreased white cell or blood platelet count, dermatitis, rash, skin itching and sensitivity to light, low blood pressure, high blood sugar levels  (hyperglycemia),  muscle  spasm,  weakness, restlessness, urinary bladder spasm, fever, blood clot, and excess uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). Additionally, some rare side effects characterized as hypersensitivity reactions have been reported including inflammation of blood vessels, kidney inflammation, and inflammation of blood vessels or lymph ducts (angiitis).</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1722">Administration:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">When used medically to treat edema, it is often given orally in a dose of 20 mg to 80 mg per day, which is taken in  one  single  application.  For  the  treatment  of hypertension, it is generally recommended to administer</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">80 mg per day, which is given in two separate 40 mg applications  spaced  12  hours  apart.  Athletes  and bodybuilders typically use this drug (off-label) for very brief periods (several days) of water adjustment. The dosage and method of administration is tailored to the individual, dependent on the desired goals and condition of the athlete. Oral tablets are the most common form of administration. The athlete will usually start with a low dose, and increase the amount slightly on subsequent days.The main focus is to calculate the optimal dosage, as well as to determine the best intake schedule, in relation to a show or competition.The initial dosage is usually 20 mg to 40 mg, and the maximum daily intake rarely exceeds 80 mg. In order to minimize the side effects associated with this drug, it is generally used for no longer than 4-5 days.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Note that since furosemide has such a strong effect on electrolyte levels, it is generally considered much safer to add  a  potassium  sparing  agent  like  Aldactone® (spironolactone) than it is to keep increasing the amount of furosemide used. Combination diuretics like this are widely produced as prescription medicines for this reason. The use of 50 mg Aldactone® and 20 mg furosemide is a common starting point, and is believed to have a roughly similar diuretic effect to 40 mg of furosemide, but without the same level <span style=" color: #393939;">of </span>potassium loss. This dosage may be adjusted on subsequent days in order to determine the optimal amount and intake schedule, but should rarely exceed 100 mg/40 mg per day. It is important to remember that these drugs can be active for many hours. It can become difficult <span style=" color: #393939;">to </span>control the dehydrating effect with an overlapping schedule, therefore one should be</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;">careful not to administer diuretics on multiple occasions during the same day.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Injectable furosemide solutions are considered to be significantly more powerful forms of the drug milligram for milligram. Furosemide solutions can be administered intramuscularly  or  intravenously,  depending  on  the individual needs of the patient. The IV method is much more rapid acting, and produces significantly higher peak blood levels of the drug. Given that the action of furosemide can be noticed in a matter of seconds or minutes when given by injection, the effect is actually easier to judge and control with this method of use, at least under normal conditions. Since the injection is much more powerful than the oral, however, is important to emphasize that the dosage must be considerably reduced in comparison. Intramuscular injection is most common with bodybuilders and athletes, and is usually given at a dosage of 10-20 mg. Doses in excess of 40 mg per day are rarely used in the bodybuilding/athletic population.</p><p class="s163" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1723">Availability:</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">Furosemide is widely available, and is manufactured and sold  under  many  different  brand  names,  in  many countries. No version of Lasix (or any other diuretic) is currently being counterfeited on any large scale. Although it is doubtful these will circulate, make sure to never purchase the drug in 500 mg tablets.These are used only in severe medical conditions, and contain a dosage that would likely prove fatal to a healthy person.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part21.htm">&lt; Назад</a><span> | </span><a href="index.html">Содержимое</a><span> | </span><a href="part23.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
